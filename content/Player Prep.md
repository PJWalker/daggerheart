Before Session 1, there’s a few things you’ll need. Feel free to send messages or have a chat with me/each other about your ideas and questions around any of this.
# Character Info
Write some info describing your character and their history.

Across this site you’ll find a bunch of questions in yellow boxes. You don’t need to answer all of these in your background, but they’re the kind of things you should consider if relevant. Here’s one:

> [!Question] What do you look like?

That one’s probably relevant. Answer that.

Your character doesn’t need a narrative ‘backstory’. If that helps *you* figure out your character, feel free, but if you just want to give some dot points addressing relevant questions, that’s great. 
## Campaign Context
Three major events have pushed the previously peaceful relationship between [[Fanewick]] & [[Haven]] into one of disorder:
1. [[The Witherwild]]: a corruption that has become endemic across [[Fanewick]] 
2. [[Ophid's Grasp]]: a curse falling upon [[Haven]].
3. [[The Endless Spring]]: the last two falls never fell, and the planet has been in a seemingly endless spring for the past ~500 days. This has turbocharged the effects of the witherwild.

You grew up in a world at peace, but that world is quickly becoming tumultuous.

> [!question] How have the Witherwild, Ophid's Grasp, and the Endless Spring affected yourself and those around you?

> [!question] What from your upbringing may prove useful? What have you needed to leave behind?
### Initial Motivation
To get the campaign rolling, there is one question I’d really like you to address:

> [!question] Why would you help [[Vinaeya Starfen]]?

Your character should have some connection to Vinaeya that gives you a reason to be willing to do her a big favour. This is what’ll get all the players into the same room.

Ideas include:
* You’re in her family (note: she’s a [[Faun]]) 
* You’re a close friend
* You owe her a debt
* She has previously saved your life
* She has promised something to you
* You’re a paid assistant / security guard / etc to her
* You are a particularly kind/selfless character who happens to be in her vicinity.
* You received an order from your boss, patron, etc.
* You have an existing bond to another party member (and *they* have a reason to help)
## Locations
The main focus of this initial campaign is going to be [[Fanewick]], with [[Haven]] also being involved. But your character can be from anywhere. 

> [!question] Where did you grow up? Where do you live now?

> [!question]- The campaign will start with the party in Fanewick. Why are you there?
> If you’re from Fanewick this needs no explanation.
>If not, it might be as simple as having heard that Vinaeya needs your help. Or it might be something else.

There are four broad regions in the map. Whatever you choose, feel free to describe a specific settlement/suburb/etc within the region. If they don’t work (or if being from a distant land is *the point*), we can flesh out other parts of the map.

You don’t have to be ‘common’ for your region, but if you’re in a weird spot you might want to explain why.
##  Organisations
You may decide to be a member of, or associated with any of the organisations listed. The Ferriers; Haven Emissaries; Loom of Lysara; or [[The Circle]]. Or, you might have an idea for another organisation. Or you might be unaffiliated.
## Ancestry
Choose from any of the available [[Ancestries/index|Ancestries]]

> [!Question] What is your ancestry’s relationship to where you grew up, and to where you are now?
## Community
Choose from any of the available communities: [[Highborne]], [[Loreborne]], [[Orderborne]], [[Ridgeborne]], [[Seaborne]], [[Slyborne]], [[Underborne]], [[Wanderborne]], [[Wildborne]]
> [!question] How does your community influence the organisations you are a part of or affiliate with?
## Class
Choose from any of the available classes: Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, Wizard

> [!Question] How does your class help you to achieve your goals?
# Character Build
As well as a background you’ll need an actual build. I’d recommend using [first-party character sheet app](https://app.demiplane.com/characters) once the it comes out on 20 May. You can play around with the playtest right now, but characters built with it will not be able to level up once the final version comes out.

We’ll starting at level one, so pick an Ancestry, Class, Community, and draw some Experiences from your background. We won’t lock anything in until the final version is out for everyone to look at, but not *too* much has changed.
# Token
Please find/make/draw a token to represent your character on the tabletop.

Most of my NPC tokens are from 2-minute-tabletop, so the easiest option is to make one that fits in is to use [their token editor](https://tools.2minutetabletop.com).  If you do, use a black 'base shadow', not a white outline.

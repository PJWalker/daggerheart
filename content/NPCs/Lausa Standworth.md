Wildborne Dwarf

An older woman with a thick beard carrying a barrel of ale. She is happy to stand and talk to the party (she will keep the barrel on her shoulder the entire time). If the PCs approach, she wants to know the name of every member of the partyâ€™s weapons and the date they were forged.

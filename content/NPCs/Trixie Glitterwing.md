You're looking around for the lovely [[Vinaeya]]
My saviour, my best friend, our benevolent mayor
She's busy right now, I think she's lost in prayer
I know her location, but why should I tell you where…

I guess you could just go in to drop off the package –
If you answer my riddles, I’ll grant you safe passage.

they've got plenty of time; there's not under the gun
so go away david; let me have my fun.

We’ll need to confirm that our teams are the same,
So to test you all out, you can all play my game!

(In faerie – Vanaeya: What’s going on out there? Oh nothing just some salesmen i think. )

***

Oh you’ll have so much fun, you’ll have laughter and giggles
And, I’ll take you to her after… ohh… 19 riddles.

OR

Whether friend, or foe, or somewhere in the middle
I'll show you her door after my 19th riddle.

OR
## Lots of riddles

I’ve been drafting on parchment, I’ve been though 4 reams
but you’ll solve them much faster than to you it seems

***

# Do We Have To?
I don’t make up the rules – that’s Ikla in the sky.
But if you don’t play my game, I will start to cry.

The tears of a fairy, have an embedded charm,
If you just gaze upon them, they’ll bring you much harm.

Oh, that was so mean – is someone cutting onions?
oh you’ll… forever be cursed to always have bunions!

(Flixie: that’s not a thing)

OK maybe I lied, just said one little fib.
Oh I’ve been such a baby, I’ll go back to my crib.

(Flixie: Thank you)
# Intimidated
The key, the key – it’s under that stone
Just take it now, please, and leave us alone!
# Persuaded
A key, a key – there’s one under the stone
You could just pick that up, and enter her home
But I’ve got lots of riddles; I’ll give them for free
With [[Vinaeya]] so busy I’m getting lonely.



# Leaving
You guys were a bright spot in a monotone day
Are you sure that you really must go right away?

# Riddles
## Hope
With me you’ll be fearless, lest I turn into scars; *A New Me* is fighting, between all the stars.
**—[[Hope]]**

Yes yes, that’s it, the answer is Hope!
Isn’t this so much better than making me mope?

***

Well then, without any further adieu
I’ll move right along, to riddle number two:

## Key
I’ve been cut just once, and I did not bleed;
I have many teeth, but no mouth to feed;
Til I take my turn, all of you must yield,
With me in your hand, an ingress is revealed;
**—Key**

Yes a key, a key, there’s one under that stone;
If you’d just picked that up, you could enter the home
But since riddles you like; I’ve got many more,
I… await your ovations & calls for encore?
## [[Rohkin]]
He’s really quite horny, but not one to goon
Eponymously he’s what some call the moon
***—[[Rohkin]]***

Wait that’s too tricky, with what through you through have been
Its that thing in the sky, we call him Rohkin.

So sorry for that, that one was no fun,
but our game isn’t over, it’s barely begun.


## Ferry
They take you from one side to other of sea,
their name it sounds just barely different from me.
**—[[Ferriers|Ferry]]**
## The First Circle
They made their oasis in body of snake
But now all around them the land it doth bake
— [[The First Circle]] / [[The Circle]] / [[Fanewick]]
## Your Word
You must give us this thing, in order to keep it.
It’s not what you bring; you need only speak it.
**— My Word**
## Letter
I start with an L, and I end with an R,
Put me in an envelope and I’ll go far.
**— Letter**
## Envelope
I start with an E and I end with and E;
And I only have but one letter between.
**—Envelope**
## Trixie
Some say I’m a drag, but I think I’m swell
I’m not quite a barbie, but am a Mattel.
**—Trixie**

Yes, trixie – that’s me – you got it correct,
Vinaeya said no-one’d get it; I’d say she got rekt.
## Oberon
The king of my people, he sits on his throne
That’s also the place that one of you calls home
**—Oberon**

You thought but a second, and then you pulled through
Now don’t you go blaming me for doxxing you
## Cloud
[[Ikla]] up there paints me each day of his life
In your last fantasy he was followed by Strife.
**— Cloud**
## Map
I’ve seen the world, but never roam
Upon my face you’ll find your home.
**— Map**
## Dictionary
I’ll help you decide between two kinds of grey
With me, yesterday will come after today
**— Dictionary**
## Tree
Didn’t want to be showy, but I’ve got many rings
A growing collection, in these endless springs
**—Tree**
## Pencil
We’ll get out the message; when I take your hand
The further I go, the shorter I stand.
## The Letter S
It’s weird, I can see, though I am not an I.
Most of what you assess; not what you let go by.

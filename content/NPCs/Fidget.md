Wildborne Human

A young child who will not stop wiggling – it’s clear how they earned their name. They are often busy scurrying up the trees in town, lighting the lanterns that hang from the branches. They know the fastest ways through the village. If the PCs approach, they are curious what life is like outside of Hush.

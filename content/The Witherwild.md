A corruption is spreading throughout [[Fanewick]]. Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, others claim is sprang from the bogs, but wherever it comes from, it brings about horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into “Verdant” beings. 

Plants sprint to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws.

Even harmless creatures have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. 

When a person is corrupted by the with, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm, they become a nightmarish hybrid of their former selves, and of plant or beast. The Witherwild will slowly replace the personality of victims with the same drive for consumption exhibited by the rest of the corrupt Fanewick. 

Though the Withered may manage to retain a semblance of who they are for a time, eventually they’ll face the final loss of their personhood.

The fanewoods were once a place of great abundance, teeming with vibrant flora and fauna, and communities that lived in harmony with the spirits of the forest.

But something has tipped the world off balance. Instead of the normal waning as the woods moved into fall & winter, wherever you look, the have continued to spring forth endlessly. 

Oversized Trees and blossoms so dense they blot out the sun. Wild creatures have grown into monstrosities, and villages on the forest’s edge struggle under the weight of the unchecked wilds. 

Meanwhile, Haven’s emissaries have discovered the secret to cultivating the ‘Maniflower', and seek to reclaim the Fanewoods in order to democratise the arcane, and bring about a revolutionary new source of magical power.

Why has the Great Owl Nikta left the fanewoods?

## Gods & Religion
The gods of this world are demonstrably real, and several minor deities are commonly in contact with the [[The Mortal Realm]]. You will almost certainly meet and talk to some.

The campaign is going to start on the way to Fanewick, so it should make sense that the character is there. So long as you’re on the east side of Aestia & south of Fulgon, it’s reasonable to just visit. If you’re on the *west* side, or off the map entirely, you’ve gone on a noteworthy trek to get here, and there’s probably a reason for that. 

Anyone from Haven who wants to start off *in* the Haven Emissaries, or anyone in the west who wants to be doing a task for them; I’ve got a built-in reason for you. (You’re delivering a package). (Also, if no-one’s doing that, there’ll be a bit of a DMPC taking that role, just for this session, because – hey I prepped stuff.)


Fanewick is the largest community east of River Aestia, so anything that requires a player to go into civilisation, that can plausibly lead to Fanewick. If you’ve got specific ideas that would require Fanewick have specific amenities, let me know. 

  

Vanaeya is a well known elder & cleric across the lands; and the recent events ma. A personal connection to her would be a strong way to ground a character in the fabric of the campaign.

  

Any devotee. Also – just broadly speaking if you want to play a character that’s been ‘powered down’ to level 1, a _former_ Seraph of Nikta would be an interesting choice. (Whether you become a seraph of another god, or dedicate yourself to some other class) 

  

People from the western half of the map, but not from Haven… I’ve got less specific motivation for you guys to be there, If you want something personal or idiosyncratic, that’s cool - we can add all sorts of elements to Fanewick to support you needing to come here.

Lesser Gods are going to be _really_ present in the campaign. You’re going to directly encounter at least a couple of them. If you’re a Seraph, we’ll establish what domain your god covers and what they’re like. Even if you’re not a Seraph, it’d be good to consider

We’re starting at level one, so the character’s history should reflect that. These are fledgling adventurers, or unlikely heroes, at the *start* of their journey. They aren’t battle-hardened commanders.

We’re going to start at a gathering in honour of [[Vinaeya Starfen]] – to justify coming together at all, I’d like everyone to either:
1. Have an existing (relatively positive) relationship with Vinaeya
2. Have an existing (relatively positive) relationship with another [[PC]]

# Brainstorming
Before you make any definitive choices, you might want to briefly look at all of the materials available to you and formulate an idea for what kind of character you want to make. 

This doesn’t need to be specific and isn’t required to begin, but having a basic concept to start from like “a circus performer who uses magic” or “a captain who lost their ship at sea” might help you make choices as you move through each step.

# Class
# Ancestry
# Community
# Traits
# Background

* Where did you grow up? Did you leave? Why?
* What is your ancestry and community’s ‘place’ within the area you grew up? How has that affected you?
* Why are you in Fanewick at the moment? (There’s a catch-all answer, but maybe you have some specific business.)
* What from your upbringing will prove useful as an adventurer? What will you need to leave behind? 
* What does your character want to achieve? Why?
* How does your class help you to achieve your goals?

# Experiences

#  Organisations
You may decide to be a member of, or associated with: 
* The [[Ferriers]] 
* [[Haven Emissaries]] 

# Token
Please find/make/draw a token to represent your character on the tabletop.

Most of my NPC tokens are from 2-minute-tabletop, so the easiest option is to make one that fits in is to use [their token editor](https://tools.2minutetabletop.com).  If you do, use a black 'base shadow', not a white outline.

# Backstory
We’re starting at level one, so the character’s story need not reflect a *huge* amount of prior adventuring experience. I’m looking for either fledgling adventurers, *or* unlikely heroes.  but should suggest a motivation for it. 

This is particularly true if your character is established to be *from* [[Fanewick]], since the region will be challenging *despite* it being local.

More broadly, [[PC|PCs]] of a normal age range will have grown up in a period of peace that appears to be coming to a close. They are not veteran soldiers.

# Relationships
[[Vinaeya Starfen]] grew up in [[Haven]], and served much of her life as an ambassador to [[Fanewick]] - she has recently retired from that role, and continues to live in her bungalow near [[Fanewick]].

Your character should have some connection to Vinaeya that gives you a reason to be willing to do her a big favour. This is what’ll get all the players into the same room.

Ideas include:
* You’re in her family (note: she’s a [[Faun]]) 
* You’re a close friend
* You owe her a debt
* She has previously saved your life
* She has promised something to you
* You’re a paid assistant / security guard / etc to her
* You are a particularly kind/selfless character who happens to be in her vicinity.
* You received an order from your boss, patron, etc.
* You have an existing bond to another party member (and *they* have a reason to help)

It’s also good for some of you guys to have pre-existing relationships to one another. I’ll start you guys off in a way that pushes you all together, but it’ll make perfect sense if there were existing pairs etc.

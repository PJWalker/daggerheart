We’re starting at level one, so the character’s history should reflect that. These are fledgling adventurers, or unlikely heroes, at the *start* of their journey. They aren’t battle-hardened commanders.

We’re going to start at a gathering in honour of [[Vinaeya Starfen]] – to justify coming together at all, I’d like everyone to either:
1. Have an existing (relatively positive) relationship with Vinaeya
2. Have an existing (relatively positive) relationship with another [[PC]]

# Brainstorming
Before you make any definitive choices, you might want to briefly look at all of the materials available to you and formulate an idea for what kind of character you want to make. 

This doesn’t need to be specific and isn’t required to begin, but having a basic concept to start from like “a circus performer who uses magic” or “a captain who lost their ship at sea” might help you make choices as you move through each step.

Hit Points (HP) represent a character’s ability to withstand physical injury. When a character takes damage, they lose 1 to 4 HP, based on their [[damage thresholds]]:

- If the damage is >2x character’s Severe damage threshold, lose 4HP
- If the damage is at or above the character’s Severe damage threshold, lose 3 HP.
- If the damage is at or above the character’s Major damage threshold but below their Severe damage threshold, lose 2 HP.
- If the damage is below the character’s Major damage threshold, they lose 1 HP.
- If incoming damage is reduced to 0, no HP is lost.

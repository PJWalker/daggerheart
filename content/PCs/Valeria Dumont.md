%%
You had known Yanna from your time together in the [[Loom of Lysara]]. You'd always been fastitious in your studies, while hhe was much more of a wildcard, working in fits and spurts on whatever topic caught his fancy.

Ultimately the loom was not the place for a spirit like his, and he went on his own path.
Initially you tried to keep in touch, but each of your lives moved forward, they also moved apart.

Still, he was a friend.

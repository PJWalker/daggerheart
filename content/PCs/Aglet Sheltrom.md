Question:

You’re an investigative journalist of sorts,

what sort of attachments would you see yourself having to your audience?

IE – are you a solitary writer looking to make a longer work over a longer period, or would it make sense for you to be linked to a broader publishing guild?

Cool, I’m gonna give you a [[Oration Orb|Speaking Orb]] that is attached to the Publisher’s Guild in [[Aberest]].

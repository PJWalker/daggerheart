# Question
* What was your partner like?
* What if your partner has been afflicted by [[The Witherwild]]?
* Your partners horns would have, and teeth grown into oversized fangs. He's still… there, but he isn't quite the same. How has this affected you?


You want to start a family. So there's a father, right. The father has been '[[The Witherwild|withered]]'. At first you were just looking for a cure for him, but as you’ve seen how [[The Witherwild]]  has affected the whole region, you’ve vowed to help bring about the kind of world you would like to bring a family into.

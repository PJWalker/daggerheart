* You had overheard that there was a bounty of a chest of gold on his head, that the [[Ashwalkers]] were looking to collect. It was a hefty sum – but he was a friend and a confidant. You sought to find him and figure out what he'd done to draw such ire.
* That brought you into [[Fanewick]] this morning – your sources had said he would be there, but as yet you haven't seen nor heard mention of him.
* You’re laying low in the town – whatever he had done, it'd be best to keep out of it.

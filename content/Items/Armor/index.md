title: Armor
---
Every armor has a name, base damage thresholds, and a base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.

- An armor’s **base armor score** indicates how many Armor Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PC’s Armor Score can’t exceed 12.
- An armor’s **base thresholds** determine its wearer’s major and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to calculate their final damage thresholds.
- An armor’s **feature** is a special rule that stays in effect while the armor is equipped.

While **unarmored**, your character’s base Armor Score is 0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe threshold is equal to twice their level.

# Reducing Incoming Damage

When you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark Armor Slots. If an effect temporarily increases your Armor Score, it increases your available Armor Slots by the same amount; when the effect ends, so does the availability of these Armor Slots.

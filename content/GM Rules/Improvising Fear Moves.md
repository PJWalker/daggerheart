Whether you’re improvising adversaries and environments or using existing ones, you might find a moment where you want to put your thumb on the scale to make something dramatic happen or to escalate the scene. You can always improvise a GM move, but there might be situations where you want to make an especially hard move. In those situations, you can make a Fear move. By spending Fear when you declare the move, you communicate and respect the scale of the action you’re taking.

A Fear move should redefine a scene, change the terms, raise the stakes, modify or move the location, or accomplish another pivotal action.

Fear moves commonly include one or more of these elements:

- Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their appearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context.
- An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.
- An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the party.

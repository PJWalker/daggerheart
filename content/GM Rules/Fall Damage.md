If a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take:

- A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage.
- A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.
- A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death, at the GM’s discretion.

If a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.

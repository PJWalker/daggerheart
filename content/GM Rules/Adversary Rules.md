When an adversary is in the spotlight and makes a move such as attacking a target or picking a lock, the GM can move them within their Close range as part of their action. For example, the adversary can pick a lock to open a door and then move within their Close range toward a PC inside the room beyond. If the GM wants to move the adversary somewhere beyond their Close range but within their Far or Very Far range, this uses their entire action, but the adversary doesnâ€™t have to succeed on an Agility Roll like a PC would.

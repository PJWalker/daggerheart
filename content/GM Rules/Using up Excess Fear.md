If you find yourself coming into a battle with a large amount of Fear (especially over 10), consider the following approaches:

# Act First
Spend a Fear immediately to interrupt the PCs and spotlight an adversary to begin the fight.

# Spend Consistently
Each time your turn comes around, make a GM move, then spend a Fear to make an additional move. If you gained Fear from a PC’s roll, consider spending that one as well, either on an additional GM move or a Fear Feature. Your pool of Fear will slowly deplete, but this method will provide significant power every time play returns to you.

# Come out Strong
You might choose to spend enough Fear to spotlight a majority of the adversaries during your first GM turn. This is a big move that can put the PCs on the back foot at the beginning of the fight, giving them the opportunity to feel like they’re turning the fight around.

# Draw Blood
Every time an adversary misses an attack, you might spend a Fear to spotlight additional adversaries until one of them successfully strikes a PC. This can help make your GM turn feel dynamic even when your first attack misses.

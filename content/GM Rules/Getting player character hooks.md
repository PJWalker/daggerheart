During session zero, look for hooks and nuggets of ideas to use as creative inspiration throughout the campaign. This can be things as small as a turn of phrase or the name of a creature or things as big as a player describing a climactic scene they want for their character at the end of the campaign.

You’ll especially want to note what the players give as their answers for the background and connections prompts while creating their characters. Those answers will form the bulk of the initial material for you to use to tie the story of the campaign to the characters, especially if you want that story to emerge from those characters’ worlds and lives.

You might also choose to frame your questions with additional narrative you think is interesting. If you do, leave space for that player to push back on your additions to their answers and discuss as needed:

- “Jasper, how did you get the Crystal of the Sunbearer? And what does it whisper to you at night before you drift off to sleep?”
- “The simiah mentioned that his sister settled in a small town. Sprout, what do you think about having that sister be from the town you accidentally destroyed?”

Keep your GM principles in mind throughout this process – these apply to all stages of the campaign, not just in-scene play.

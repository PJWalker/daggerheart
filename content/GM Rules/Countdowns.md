When you introduce a countdown, you can either directly tell the players you’ve done so (“I’m starting a countdown to when the army attacks—what do you want to do before then?”) or imply it through your narration (“The bridge is starting to crack, and it won’t last long.”). It’s up to you whether you keep the countdown die visible to the players (increasing the tension each time it ticks down) or secretly use it to track an event they can’t predict.

- **Activation:** What moment in the fiction prompts you to activate the countdown? For example, a countdown might activate when the PCs stealthily enter an enemy camp.
- **Advancement:** When does the countdown advance, prompting you to tick down the die by 1? For example, a countdown might advance whenever a PC makes an action roll, or it might advance only on certain roll results.
- **Effect:** What happens when the countdown ends? For example, a countdown might trigger a powerful enemy attack or a wave of allies arriving to save the day.

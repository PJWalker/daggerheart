# Play to Find Out What Happens
Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make, and the people they become.
# Ask Questions & Incorporate the Answers
Ensure the players’ ideas are included results in a narrative that supports the whole group’s creativity
# Begin and End with the Fiction
Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics back to the fiction.
# Cultivate Curiosity
Follow what catches the players’ interest to foster an environment of creative inquiry.
# Earn your Players’ Trust
Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your mistakes.
# Keep the Story Moving
Advance the story through escalating action, new information, or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it succeeds or fails.
# Tell them what they would know
Don’t hide obvious details or important information from the players.
# Ground the world in motive
NPCs and creatures should act based on clear, coherent goals. 
# Reframe rather than reject
If a player’s suggestion or description is generally implausible or out of sync with what has been established in the game, try to find a way to reframe the situation and work with them rather than rejecting their idea outright. You might ask the table what it would take to accomplish a seemingly implausible task, or call out a more workable part of the suggestion and encourage the player to build on that aspect.
# Work in moments and montages
When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savored and which shouldn’t linger.
# Create a meta conversation
Ensure players always feel comfortable shifting out of character to discuss something. Whether as creative collaborators or friends enjoying a game together, players should feel empowered to utilize safety tools during the game or ask for clarifications concerning the story or rules.

# Pitfalls

## Undermining the Heroes
If a roll doesn’t go well, show how it was impacted by an adversary’s prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected surprises, rather than the PC’s incompetence.
## Always telling the players what to roll
Let the players decide how to handle a challenge, and reward their creativity
## Letting scenes drag
Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the table’s energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.
## Singular Solutions
Don’t get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the players have a clever idea, make it work.
## Overplanning
Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think through your options.
## Hoarding Fear
Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will always generate more.

Spending more Fear at the start of a combat or during a big moment can generate a lot of tension and set the stakes. This helps give shape to the scene, where the PCs are on the ropes, being reactive more than proactive as they fight to get their footing. Then, as they get their equilibrium, they become proactive, directly pursuing their objectives. Once they’ve made some strides toward those objectives, they may roll with Fear. This creates an opening for you to make another Fear move to complicate the scene.

This back-and-forth creates a dynamic scene, keeping the PCs on their toes and ultimately making the result all the more satisfying whether it’s a hard-earned victory or a heartbreaking defeat.

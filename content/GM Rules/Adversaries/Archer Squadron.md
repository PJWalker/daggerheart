***Focused Volley - Action:*** Spend a Fear to target a point within Far range. Make an attack with advantage against all targets within Close range of that point. Targets the Squadron succeeds against take `dice:1d10+4` physical damage.

***Suppressing Fire - Action:*** Mark a Stress to target a point within Far range. Until the next roll with Fear, a creature who moves within Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll. On a failure, they take `dice:2d6+3` physical damage. On a success, they take half damage.

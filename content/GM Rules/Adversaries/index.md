## ADVERSARY STAT BLOCKS

All the information required to run an adversary is contained in their stat block. An adversary’s stat block includes their:

### NAME

Each stat block has a unique **name**. Abilities that affect adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.

### TIER

Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain **tier**. If you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, adjust their stats.

### TYPE

The adversary’s type appears alongside their tier. An adversary’s **type** represents the role they play in a conflict. The adversary types are:

- **Bruisers:** tough; deliver powerful attacks.
- **Hordes:** groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit.
- **Leaders:** command and summon other adversaries.
- **Minions:** easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.
- **Ranged:** fragile in close encounters but deal high damage at range.
- **Skulks:** maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents.
- **Socials:** present challenges around conversation instead of combat.
- **Solos:** present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support.
- **Standards:** representative of their fictional group.
- **Supports:** enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents.

### DESCRIPTION

### MOTIVES & TACTICS

### DIFFICULTY

The Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless otherwise noted.

### DAMAGE THRESHOLDS, HIT POINTS, AND STRESS

These systems function the same way they do for PCs. The numbers listed after “Threshold” are the adversary’s Major and Severe Thresholds.

### ATTACK MODIFIER

When you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or penalty to your attack roll.

### STANDARD ATTACK

A description of the adversary’s primary mode of inflicting harm on the PCs. It includes the attack’s **name**, its effective **range**, and the **damage** it deals on a success. Using an adversary’s **standard attack** is a GM move.

### EXPERIENCE (OPTIONAL)

The GM can spend a Fear to add an adversary’s relevant Experience to raise their attack roll or increase the Difficulty of a roll made against them.

#### EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES

- Acrobatics
- Ambusher
- Bartering
- Blademaster
- Bodyguard
- Commander
- Hunt from Above
- Intimidation
- Intrusion
- Keen Senses
- Magical Knowledge
- Nature’s Friend
- Navigation
- Nobility
- Quick Reflexes
- Socialite
- Stealth
- Tracker

### FEATURE(S)

There are three kinds of adversary features: **actions, reactions, and passives.** Note: each adversaries stress is tracked individually. If a feature requires the GM to spend Stress to activate it, the Stress must come from the adversary whose feature is being activate. If a feature has a Fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any Fear already spent—for instance, to interrupt the PCs and put the spotlight on the adversary.

- **Actions:** a special attack or other unique action that the adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them.
- **Reactions:** special effects that take effect when their trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on the adversary.
- **Passives:** special abilities that remain in effect by default and require no resources or triggers to activate.

### FEAR FEATURE(S)

High-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate.

## EXAMPLE ADVERSARY FEATURES

### ACTIONS

***Haymaker - Action:*** Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X direct physical damage.

***Shredding Strike - Action:*** Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X physical damage and the target must mark an Armor Slot without gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the damage).

***More Where That Came From - Action:*** Summon three Jagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range.

### REACTIONS

***Heavy Hitter - Reaction:*** When this adversary deals damage with a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to gain a +X bonus to the damage roll.

***Team-Up - Reaction:*** When another adversary within Very Close range of this adversary deals X damage to a creature, you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against that same creature. On a success, combine the damage.

***Momentum - Reaction:*** When this adversary makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.

### PASSIVES

***Horde (X) - Passive:*** When the Horde has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage instead.

***Minion (X) - Passive:*** This adversary is defeated when they take any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against.

***Relentless (X) - Passive:*** This adversary can be spotlighted up to X times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Slow - Passive:*** When you spotlight this adversary and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and they can act.

***Arcane Form - Passive:*** This adversary is resistant to magic damage.

***Armored Carapace - Passive:*** When this adversary takes physical damage, reduce it by X.

### FEAR FEATURES

***Explosion - Action:*** Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 magic damage and are knocked back to Far range.

## BUILDING BALANCED ENCOUNTERS

When planning a battle, start with **[(3 x the number of PCs in combat) + 2] Battle Points** and make the following adjustments:

- **-1** for an easier or shorter fight
- **-2** if you’re using 2 or more Solo adversaries
- **-2** if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to all adversaries’ damage rolls
- **+1** if you choose an adversary from a lower tier
- **+1** if you don’t include any Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or Solos
- **+2** for a harder or longer fight

Then spend your Battle Points to add an adversary to the encounter:

- **Spend 1 point** for each group of Minions equal to the size of the party.
- **Spend 1 point** for each Social or Support adversary.
- **Spend 2 points** for each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard adversary.
- **Spend 3 points** for each Leader adversary.
- **Spend 4 points** for each Bruiser adversary.
- **Spend 5 points** for each Solo adversary.

## DEFEATED ADVERSARIES

When an adversary marks their last Hit Point, they are defeated: incapacitated, tied up, routed, killed, or anything else the table decides makes sense.

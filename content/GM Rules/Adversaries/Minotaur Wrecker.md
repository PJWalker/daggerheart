***Ramp Up - Passive:*** You must spend a Fear to spotlight the Minotaur. While spotlighted, they can make their standard attack against all targets within range.

***Charging Bull - Action:*** Mark a Stress to charge through a group within Close range and make an attack against all targets in the Minotaurâ€™s path. Targets the Minotaur succeeds against take `dice:2d6+8` physical damage and are knocked back to Very Far range. If a target is knocked into a solid object or another creature, they take an extra `dice:1d6` damage (combine their damage).

***Gore - Action:*** Make an attack against a target within Very Close range, moving the Minotaur into Melee range of them. On a success, deal `dice:2d8` direct physical damage.

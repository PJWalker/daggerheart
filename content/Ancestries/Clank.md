# General Info
Sentient mechanical beings built to resemble humanoids, animals, or inanimate objects. Their bodies come in a wide array of sizes and may change and adapt based on time and need. 

Many clanks have highly specialised physical features, such as clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. Many embrace an individual’s desires for body modifications—including those based in style as well as function. Members of other ancestries turn to clank artisans to construct highly customised mobility aids and physical adornments. 

Other ancestries can create clanks, but it’s also common for clanks to build one another. A clank’s lifespan extends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time and will deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency.

# Merchant Cart

> We begin with the party entering made the Fanewoods, a sprawling forest of strange and diverse trees some say are even older than the Forgotten Gods.
>
> From within your carriage, behind the jostling of the caravan: the low calls of the cat-moths, the croak of the lemur-toads, the skittering of a family of squiriguanas in the underbrush.
>
> One of you is driving the carriage. Who is it?

When a player volunteers their character as the carriage driver, you can ask them a question like:

(find someone familiar w/ the fanewoods) As you watch the trees on the passing by, you notice…  they look different from what you remember. What has changed about these trees?

Describe the trees the party passes, specifically including details from their answer.



> As the carriage swerves around a tight corner, you see an cart, turned over sideways across the the path.
>
> You see fruits and vegetables scattered across the trail.
>
> At the side of the carriage, you see a large creature with the body of a wolf, the face of an owl, and large wings adorning its back.
>
> – A **[[Strixwolf Mother|strixwolf]]**
>
> It lifts its head – and as it registers your presence, its beak opens, dropping the dead human hand that had it had been gnawing upon.
>
> It stares at your caravan, then glances back to two small pups, batting around an apple behind her.

(Driver) what do you do?

***

**If they approach, ask how.**

> The strixwolf is wary of your movement – can I get you to make a Presence roll

Difficulty: 10.

**CRIT:** the strixwolf gathers its pups, and cautiously moves toward you - head down, tail wagging. It curls up in front of you and starts cooing.

**FAIL:** The strixwolf looks direct you and lets out an almighty screech. You see a row of razor sharp teeth behind its beak. **Mark a stress**

**SUCC:** The strixwolf bows its head, then darts over to its pups, beginning to pick them up.

**FEAR:** The mother then looks over into forest and hoots out to something among the trees. You know you might not be alone for long.

***

**Searching the cart:** it’s been stripped of any
**Attacking the strixwolf:** here’s the [[Strixwolf Mother|stat block]]
**Scaring the strixwolf:** it’ll pull its pups onto its back & fly into a nearby tree
**Investigating:** there are remnants of thorny brambles tangled around the wheel of the carriage, and leading toward the forest.

If they try to leave the scene or go into the forest, they’re **ambushed**
# Ambush
![[Initial Adventure script-1747845705234.webp]]

**Difficulty 14 instinct roll**

**Success**
You hear a branch snap, and then turn to see a flash of a dagger in the darkness – you notice the group of Thistlefolk in the forest just as they charge.

You get to act first, who wants to start us off?

**Failure**
You hear a rustling in the branches, but before you turn around, the Thistlefolk are atop you – it’s an ambush!.

So these guys have an *Ambush* feature which lets them make an attack immediately. This only happens when they enter the scene, so it won’t be like this every time. But right now, they are slashing at you with daggers, protected by armor made of polished stones.

## Creatures
1x [[Thistlefolk Thief]]
3x [[Thistlefolk Ambusher]]

**Goal:** Use the ambushers to distract the party, while the thief attempts to steal their carriage.

> [!NOTE] Explaining Combat
> When I make an attack, I roll a d20, add its attack modifier (+3), and then compare it to the target’s Evasion. If it hits, I make a damage roll (2d4+3)
>
> Then, you compare the incoming damage to your damage thresholds; use armor if you’d like, and then mark hit points.

When combat ends, they get into hush without any further incident

# Arrival in Hush

The path leads you further into the jungle until you spot a large stone pillar, carved top to bottom with archaic symbols. As you pass beyond the stone marker, you feel a small sensation, like the popping of a bubble.

There’s no obvious visual barrier, but there is a distinctive safe and comforting air. You begin to see the treehouses and other structures along the path. This is your entrance into the village of Hush.

As your carriage rolls in, a few smiling faces turn to you and wave toward the party.

There is lively music drifting from the tavern at the centre of town.

You know you need to find [[Vinaeya Starfen]], to deliver the package, but you don’t know where in the village she lives. They don’t exactly have a postal system.

What would you like to do?


*****

Someone should point them to the Tavern.



# The [[Clover Tavern]]

![[Clover Tavern]]

## Npcs to Talk to
* [[Nordruck]] 
- [[Fidget]]
- [[Lausa Standworth]]
- [[Halython Fives]]
- [[Daviiden]]
## Bar Chatter
They’re celebrating the First Frost festival. Kind of



## Passives
**Sing For Your Supper** - Passive: A PC can perform one time for the guests by making a Presence Roll. On a success, they earn 1d4 handfuls of gold (2d4 if they critically succeed). On a failure, they mark a Stress. *What piece do you perform? What does that piece mean to you? When’s the last time you performed it for a crowd?*

**Bar Fight** - Bar Fight! - Action: Spend a Fear to have a bar fight erupt in the tavern. When a PC tries to move through the tavern while the fight persists, they must succeed on an Agility or Presence Roll or take 1d6+2 physical damage from a wild swing or thrown object. A PC can try to activate this feature by succeeding on an action roll that would provoke tavern patrons.

*Who started the fight? What will it take to stop it?*
## Moving on…

When it’s time to move on:

> [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] – well she’s very busy right now, but if you’ve traveled so far, I’m sure she’ll be more than hospitable. We would be lost without her. She keeps this whole place protected by a powerful ward so that no dangers from the [[Places/Fanewoods/index]] can pass into town.
> 
> You’ll find her house to the south, through the farmland. It’s hanging from one of the old Sablewood trees, you can’t miss it.

# The House

> Making your way past the homes of the village, then through the farmlands of Hush, you see a variety of crops that have begun to cultivate a thin layer of glowing blue moss over the top of their fruits and vegetables. They pulse softly like a heartbeat as you pass.
>
> Among the thriving groves, you notice that the Sablewood trees in this area have hundreds of unique faces carved into all sides, the eyes peering in every direction.
>
> One tree, taller than the rest, bears Vinaeya’s home, like an overripe fruit. It hangs from a braid of rope, as wide around as a giant’s forearm, tied to a massive branch and counterweighted by a cabin-sized bolder lying at the base of the tree. The stone is marked with a collection of symbols and the cabin windows flash with a soft, yellow-green light.

- **If they try to call to [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] from below** there is no response, but the light within still flickers.
- **If they try to cut the counterweight rope:** it immediately blasts them back a few feet, dealing a point of Stress
- **If they try to climb the tree,** its an Agility Roll with difficulty 13.
  On failure, a limb of the tree grabs them, gently sets them down on the forest floor, then resumes its original form.

**When they finally do something to successfully get Vinaeya’s attention,** use the following to describe her as she emerges from her cabin to greet them.

“Are you the group Emeris sent from the capital? Oh my, you’re rather late aren’t you. Come in, come in.”

As Vinaeya lowers her home and invites you inside, you’ll notice the treehouse is surprisingly spacious. The main room is a crowd of potion bottles, spellbooks, runes, plants, and small creatures of all kinds. But, no one could classify this place as messy. It’s clear that if anyone moved a single item even an inch, the old faerie would notice.

Vinaeya is curious about the players journey, the NPC who directed them toward her house, and how each of them imagined they might die one day.

At some point, she’ll ask about the package, and open it.

> Inside the package lies a massive stone with a lion’s face carved into it.
>
> (someone from Haven) identifies this as the keystone of Haven’s main archway. Vinaeya nods sagely as soon as she sees it, saying: “Of course the King would keep this delivery secret. If anyone knew your city was no longer warded, you would be conquered before sunrise.” With this ominous warning, she starts to unfurl her treehouse yet again. “We must travel to the Open Vale to revitalize the ward. But such an effort of magic will attract dangerous creatures from the darkest reaches of the Fanewoods. I’ll need your help.”

# The Ward Renewal
## The Open Vale
> On direction from the Vinaeya, your carriage pulls into a mysterious clearing in the shape of a perfect circle, the only area of the Fanewoods you’ve seen without trees to block out the sky. This is the Open Vale.

 The open vale is where she first forged the ward pillars that reside on all four corners of Hush, keeping the village safe. She almost died in that ritual, but is reluctant to say more for fear of angering the Forgotten Gods. Engage the PCs in conversation, then…

> Vinaeya’s ears perk up in a disconcerting way. “This is good. Stop, stop. Yes, here. Now come help me, I’m old.” This time, she unfolds the carriage as she did with her home and stands over the crate, humming. Her body starts to glow brighter, flickering in the night.

> “I will need an hour of time to prepare. You all, enjoy the night air while you can. We’ll be very busy soon.”

## Take a [[Short Rest]]
Players can:
- Tend to wounds
- clear [[Stress]]
- repair [[armour]]
- Prepare
They should describe how they do so.

GM takes `dice:1d4` Fear.

# The Ritual
> Vinaeya lets out a shrill cry, “The keystone has finally responded! Quickly, surround me, the ritual must begin or I’ll lose the pathway! Hurry!” Her body begins glowing brighter and brighter still as her eyes roll backwards into her head and the entire carriage lifts a foot off the ground.

- 4x Ancient Skeletons go close to Vinaeya,
- 2x Forest Wraith far away.
- Begin a countdown - It’ll tick down when an adversary is defeated, and up when vinaeya is hit. When the countdown reaches 0, the ritual is complete.

> You feel a rumble as four ancient skeletons emerge from the ground, rusted swords in hand, disturbed by the forces of magic being used by Vinaeya. In the distance, two Forest Wraiths float ominously towards you.
# Combat
## Environment
### The Open Vale
Vengeance of the Vale - Action: Spend 1 fear; summon 2 [[Ancient Skeleton]]s from the ground within very close range of a PC.
### Adversaries
3x [[Forest Wraith]]
4x [[Ancient Skeleton]]
## Adversary Goal
Interrupt the ritual & get to Vinaeya.
### Player Goal
Protect Vinaeya until the ritual is complete
# Combat Complete
> As you deliver a powerful blow, the ritual ends! The carriage comes falling to the ground as the keystone vibrates with arcane energy. Then, all at once, a soundless explosion erupts from Vinaeya, dissipating any last enemies who might remain. The clearing is quiet once again. Back inside the treehouse, not but an hour later, the keystone sits suspended carefully above a rumbling fire in the hearth. Vinaeya, who looks even older now than she did before, sits cross-legged in an over-stuffed chair. There is an exhaustion in her voice as she speaks. “You fought hard. I’m not surprised, of course. The King keeps good company. I’m very glad you were there.”

> “The keystone will need a week, maybe more, to allow the magic to settle. I’ll need to watch it carefully to ensure nothing cracks or becomes sentient or anything of the like. You know how it is. And in the meantime, after you rest and gather yourselves, have a nice hot meal and warm bath, I have one more thing to ask of you.” We pull out of Vinaeya’s home, out of the forest itself, to view the verdant expanse from above, and see twisting stone spires breaking through the treeline, each with a flame flickering within the tower like a beacon. She continues: “There’s a Spire, just west of here, maybe a few hours walk. I felt it on the way to the ritual. Its power was… strange. The light felt weaker than it should be. I think something might be terribly wrong with the Spirekeeper, and I fear what will happen if its fire is extinguished altogether. When you’re ready, come back, and I’ll give you my map so you can make it there safely. It’s good to have heroes in the Sablewood again.”

And that’s where we’re going to end today’s session.

# General Guidance
The purpose of the rules is to make sure we’re on the same page. If we’re both looking at the same text and disagreeing about the meaning – the rule hasn't served its purpose, and we'll make a judgement based on what is reasonable within the fiction.

If it's likely to come up again, I’ll note it down here, and we can revisit it to clarify matters going forward.

# Distances
We're not snapping to a grid, but we *are* using the defined distances in the rulebook. Because of the way diagonals work, I’ll adjudicate some ranges as a little longer than a straightforward interpretation would suggest, so that movement according to pf2e grid rules is essentially correct. Since everyone has 30ft of free movement this will practically never matter, but if it does, it does. 

Melee: 7ft
Very Close: 16ft
Close: 30ft
Far: 60ft
[[Very Far]]: 120ft

# Prices
Items & services are priced in coins, but totals are rounded to the nearest handful. If we're at a random shop, the price is the price. At a Bazaar, haggling will be an option.

# PvP
Daggerheart is not a PvP game, and straightforward PvP combat should approximately never happen. With that said, If a player attempts a hostile action against another player, the 'target' will be able to choose whether:

1. It fails without a roll (even for spells that are mechanically guaranteed to work)
2. It succeeds without a roll
3. They roll to determine the effect
4. The hostile action never happened

This includes straightforward PvP fighting, but also things like players convincing or persuading one another. 

I encourage players to let their character 'lose' in scenarios where it it makes sense and is narratively interesting. (EG if a player is convinced of a something we, as players, know is false, it may still be more fun to play the world where the party is convinced.)

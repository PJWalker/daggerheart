A small, delicate flower. Each plant produces only a single flower in its lifetime, and each flower has a single golden petal, that curls & folds in upon itself as it sways in the wind.

Manafold blooms are known to have powerful effects when consumed, and with skill this power can be put to almost any purpose. As a result, the [[Places/Haven/index|Havenites]] have been attempting to cultivate the flower, however this has thus far been unsuccessful in growing the blooms far from the leyline that runs through the [[Places/Fanewoods/index|Fanewoods]].

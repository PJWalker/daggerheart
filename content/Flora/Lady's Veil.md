The Lady’s Veil is a common in [[Fanewyck]], but for every 10000 of the white-petaled blossoms, there’s only one rare Crimson Veil, which can cure [[Ophid's Grasp]].

This deep red variant does not seem to be replicated when the flower is propagated.

 These flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. They were only foraged but recently the Havenites discovered that the Crimson Veil is the only known cure for Ophid's Grasp.

As a result, the [[Haven|Havenites]] have been attempting to cultivate the flower. They have begun to successfully farm Lady’s veils, but are yet to see a single farmed Crimson Veil.

Within [[Haven]]’s jurisdiction, anyone outside the [[Haven Emissaries]] or the farmworkers that’s caught with a Crimson Lady’s Veil will be killed on sight.

> [!GM] Unbeknownst to the players, the [[Archmage Phylax]] led a campaign to kidnap [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons]] in order to manage their growth, but in their attempt they instead knocked out and stole her ‘eye of reaping’, removing her ability to usher in the fall and causing [[The Endless Spring]] .

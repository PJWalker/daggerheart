Descriptions of plants that appear throughout the land. Mostly taken from [this reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka_dPgJGzPw&t=547s). (IE just because it's here doesn't mean its available.)

These are mostly real plants, with effects based on (but stronger than) those established in reality, or believed in folklore. 

Many active effects are hidden from you guys, but if you happen to know something about a plant IRL, you can probably guess the effect here. 

Combining ingredients may introduce additional effects; and, in particular, the [[Manafold]] will potentiate almost all reagents.

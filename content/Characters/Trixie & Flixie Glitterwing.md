Welcome to the home of the lovely [[Vinaeya]]
Our saviour, our cleric, our benevolent mayor
She's been gone for weeks though, maybe lost in prayer.
…I have a new game, will you be its first player?

(In faerie – Flixie: WTF are you doing? She said to just let them in if they — Trixie: She didn’t say we couldn’t have any fun first. Flixie: oh, fine just on with it then)

***

Oh you’ll have so much fun, you’ll have laughter and giggles
And, I’ll open the door after… ohh… 19 riddles. 

OR

Whether friend, or foe, or somewhere in the middle
I’ll open the door after my 19th riddle.

OR

I’ve been drafting on parchment, I’ve been though 4 reams
but you’ll solve them much faster than to you it seems

***

# Do we have to?
I don't make up the rules – that’s Ikla in the sky.
But if you don't play my game, we will start to cry.

The tears of a fairy, have an embedded charm,
If you just gaze upon them, they’ll bring you much harm.

Oh, that was so mean – is someone cutting onions?
oh you’ll… forever be cursed to always have bunions!

(Flixie: that’s not a thing)

OK maybe I lied, just said one little fib.
Oh I’ve been such a baby, I’ll go back to my crib.

(Flixie: Thank you)
# Intimidated
The key, the key – it’s under that stone
Just take it now, please, and leave us alone!
# Persuaded
A key, a key – there’s one under the stone
You can just pick that up, and enter the home
But I’ve got lots of riddles; I’ll give them for free
Cause without [[Vinaeya]] I’m getting lonely.
# Flixie
Flixie… she’s, well, Flixie — a drag and a bore
She' puts me to sleep then complains ‘bout my snore

So to see all you people was quite the nice sight
but… if you don’t want to play then, I’ll bid you goodnight.
# [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] 
Friend to all from the [[giants]] to the smallest whelp
If you e’er need assistance, she’s happy to help
and her Havenite friends(?) called her out for a quest
That was 5 weeks ago… and we don’t know the rest.
# [[Haven|Havenites]] 
They came wrapped in their armor; charged her with a crime 
he said stuff about treason, said she was a consignee
It seemed quite complicated; so a lot whizzed right by me
but Vanaeya assured us it all would be fine… she
promised. she’s… honest.
Oh I’m gonna vomit.

(Glitter vomit)
# Sympathy 
Thank you, but… really I shouldn’t be worried.
She’s a powerful woman, she needn’t be hurried.
But… why did she send for you all with that letter
Are you here to ensure that things truly get better?
# Leaving
You guys were a bright spot in a monotone day
Are you sure that you really must go right away?

# Riddles
## Hope
With me you’ll be fearless, lest I turn into scars; *A New Me* is fighting, between all the stars.
**—[[Hope]]**

Yes yes, that’s it, the answer is Hope!
Isn’t this so much better than making me mope?

***

Well then, without any further adieu
I’ll move right along, here riddle number two:

## Key
I’ve been cut just once, and I did not bleed;
I have many teeth, but no mouth to feed;
Til I take my turn, all of you must yield, 
With me in your hand, an ingress is revealed;
**—Key**

Yes a key, a key, there's one under that stone;
If you'd just picked that up, you could enter the home
But since riddles you like; I’ve got many more,
I… await your ovations & calls for encore?
## [[Rohkin]]
He’s really quite horny, but not one to goon
Eponymously he’s what some call the moon
***—[[Rohkin]]***

That’s the perfect answer you got it in one,
but our game isn’t over, it’s barely begun.
## Ferry 
They take you from one side to other of sea,
their name it sounds just barely different from me.

They made their oasis in body of snake
But now all around them the land it doth bake

Put me in an envelope and I’ll go far.

And I only have but one letter between.
**—Envelope**
## Trixie
Flixie says I’m a drag, but I think I’m swell
I’m not quite a barbie, but am a Mattel.
**—Trixie**

	Trixie: This is my favourite one
	Flixie: I wonder why.

Yes, trixie – that’s me – you got it correct, 
flixie said you’d not get it; I’d say she got rekt.
## Oberon
The king of my people, he sits on his throne
That’s also the place that one of you calls home
**—Oberon**

Now don’t you go blaming me for doxxing you

## Witherwild
You maybe can catch it, but never can throw
And then when you have it you grow and you grow
**—[[The Witherwild]]**

It is quite a mystery, so it’s hard to hint.

## The letter S
It’s weird, I can see, though I am not an I.
Most of what you assess; not what you let go by.

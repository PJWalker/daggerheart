The campaign is set on a planet called [[Hom]]. 
Hom has a large satellite, Rohkina, that orbits it every 24 hours. 
It orbits its star [[Ikla - Painter of Sky|Iklata]] once every 10x24 = 240 hours.

So, Hom operates primarily on a 10 day ‘cycle’, with a 5 day period where Iklata is visible (referred to as the ‘lil’), followed by 7 days of darkness (the ‘non’).

They use the terms ‘Night’ and ‘Day’ to refer to the cycle of Rohkina, (😮‍💨 I don’t have to think) but this primarily affects the tides - which are dramatically stronger than on Earth.

The specific days are referred to as the following (though tbh I’ll probably only mention 1 & 6):

1. **Iklalil** (start of the Lil, named for [[Ikla - Painter of Sky|Ikla]])
2. Miralil
3. Teralil 
4. Weralil  
5. Tharalil 
6. **Oovenon** (start of the Non, named for [[Oove - Watcher of the Nonblooms|Oove]])
7. Mironon 
8. Teronon
9. Weronon
10. Thalonon

There is (was?) a seasonal pattern wherein each 10 cycles of ‘spring’ was followed by 10 cycles of ‘fall’. They have names for the expected cycles… but [[The Endless Spring|the fall hasn’t fallen for the last ~50 cycles]], so at this point they’re just using numbers, and not everyone’s even on the same page about how many cycles into spring we are.

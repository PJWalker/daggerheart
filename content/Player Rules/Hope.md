Hope can be used to take special actions & empower abilities. Players start with 2 hope, and can generally hold up to **six** hope at a time.

During the game, you can spend Hope to help your characterâ€™s allies, apply their life experiences to challenges, and empower their spells and abilities.

Whenever you roll your Duality Dice, if you roll with Hope (meaning your Hope die rolled higher than your fear die) you gain a Hope.

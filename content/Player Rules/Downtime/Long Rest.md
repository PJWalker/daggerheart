A **long rest** is when the characters make camp, relax for a few hours, and get some rest.

 If a long rest is interrupted, the characters instead gain the benefits of a [[Short Rest]] (even if they’ve already had three short rests).

During a long rest Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then can choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice).
## Tend to All Wounds
Clear all Hit Points. You can do this to an ally instead.
## Clear All Stress
Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear all Stress.
## Repair All Armor 
Describe how you spend time repairing your armor, then clear all Armor Slots. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead.
## Prepare 
Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.
## Work on a Project
Establish or continue work on a project (see the following “Working on a Project in Downtime” section).

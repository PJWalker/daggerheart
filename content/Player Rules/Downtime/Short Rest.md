A **short rest** is when the characters stop to catch their breath, taking a break for about an hour. 

A party can take up to three short rests before their next rest must be a long rest. If a short rest is interrupted (such as by an adversary’s attack), characters don’t gain its benefits.

During a short rest, each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). 

## Tend to Wounds
Describe how you hastily patch yourself up, then clear Hit Points equal to `dice:1d4` + your [[tier]]. You can do this to an ally instead.

## Clear [[Stress]] 
Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear Stress equal to `dice:1d4` + your [[tier]].

## Repair Armor 
Clear Armor Slots equal to `dice:1d4` + your [[tier]]. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead.

## Prepare 
Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.

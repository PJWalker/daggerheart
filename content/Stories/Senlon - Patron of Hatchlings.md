Senlon is a legendary figure originating in eastern [[Drakona|Drakonic]] culture, who is said to bring gold to hatchlings during the late evening and overnight hours on Sennius eve. 

This is, of course, a fable told to children.

Throughout your childhood, each year, near the fall harvest, Senlon would come out from her slumber within [[Mount Iatus]], visit all the good drakonic hatchlings, and grant their wishes. Youâ€™d stay up as long as you could, trying to catch a glimpse of her golden scales, but you never did. But each time you'd wake up in the morning to a pile of gold underneath you - just as you had wished!

A Massive, winged creature, with obsidian scales, and impossibly sharp claws

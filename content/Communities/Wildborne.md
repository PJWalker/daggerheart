Most Wildborne were raised in the deadly environment of [[Fanewyck]]. Each has unique customs that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the territory of Faint Divinities, which may be freely shared, or closely guarded secrets.

 In exchange for protection from [[The Witherwild|the Witherwild]], some have taken jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields. Though it is back-breaking work, the Haven fires burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild, offering safety.

# Character Guidelines 
Many Wildborne are *in* Haven, but few are *from* Haven. If you choose to be a havenite wildborne, your backstory should mention how that came about.

OTOH, Wildborne is essentially the ‘default’ Wickan community and needs no particular explanation.

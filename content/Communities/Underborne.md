Most underborne were raised in the deadly environment of [[Fanewyck]], which has only become more dangerous as [[The Witherwild|the Witherwild]] progresses. Each has unique customs that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the territory of Faint Divinities, which may be freely shared, or closely guarded secrets.

 In exchange for protection from the Witherwild, some have taken jobs as farmers in Havenâ€™s flower fields. Though it is back-breaking work, the Haven fires burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild, offering safety.

# Character Creation

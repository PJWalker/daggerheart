Players might choose to build characters that come from one or neither country.

Many wanderborne have come to reside semi-permanently in Haven or [[Fanewyck]], as safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military operations in the surrounds.

* What do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden?
* How have the recent restrictions affected you?
* Because of your communitiesâ€™ transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewyck and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion?
* Your community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?
# Character Creation
* Most characters from [[Greenlily Bleach]] are wanderborne, but they are common throughout other regions too.

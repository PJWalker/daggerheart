Hello – this is both the main place.
# About these notes
Assuming I’m being careful, everything in here is stuff your characters can know.  
# Daggerheart Rules
The rules PDF is [[here]], 

Please **don’t** read the ‘Witherwild’ section, on pages 254-257. The campaign uses elements from it, though it has wound up different enough that the guide would be a weird combo of spoilers and confusing misinformation.
# My DMing

1. I am almost always going to be talking in-character for relevant parts of conversations. 
2. I will try to *proactively* give you the background information you need to have a direct (in character) conversation with relevant parties. But please feel free to *ask* if you know things about the world. Just because I haven’t said it, doesn’t mean you don’t know it.
3. I try to keep things either *wholly concrete*, or *wholly abstract*. The middle ground is rare. Daggerheart frames a similar thing as ‘Scenes & Montages’. 

## Scenes & Montages
This describes me DMing D&D, but it’s also just the recommended style in DH. (Yay validation!)

We’ll basically be flipping between narrating things in concrete detail; and glossing over potentially hours/days/weeks in moments. If I’m skipping over a moment you have more detailed ideas for, please pull me up.

You *can* go the other way, but at some level I’m moving into ‘scene’ mode because I intend it to be interesting – and that may be due to things you don’t yet know about. The main way this is likely to come up (I think) is that if I’m having a conversation with you, and in the moment you as a player are not sure how your character would navigate it, feel free to pull away from ‘In person conversation’ and let me know what your goal for the conversation is.

## Maps & Exploration


## Minor exception
In populated areas, You’ll notice a bunch of faceless NPCs with light outlines. These are ‘interchangable’ in a way all the others arent’. Feel free to talk to them – they’ll may have opinions on whatever’s going on, and depending on your interactions I might ‘promote’ them into individuality. But… jesus christ don’t try to talk to each individual one.

Hello – this is both the main place. Assuming I haven’t messed anything up, everything visible on this site is reasonable for player characters to know as background. 
# Setting
The campaign will begin with its focus on [[Fanewick]] and the nearby area.

There are various other locations established in the world, where your character might be from:
* [[Haven]] – a large city
* [[Katar]] – a township in the western savana where most [[Katari]] in the region live.
* [[Magovi]] – a swap township
* Antozen – a semi
* [[Fulgon]] – A mountainous tundra (sort of) at the base of the 
* Brazenfields – a large region of farmland that primarily serves to feed the people of Haven
* 

Various other townships and hamlets exist on the map, but

# Backstory
We’re starting at level one, so the character’s story need not reflect any huge amount of prior adventuring experience. 

This is particularly true if your character is established to be *from* [[Fanewick]], since the region will be challenging *despite* it being local.

# Relationships
I would like the PCs to have some pre-existing relationship with [[Vinaeya Starfen]]. Vinaeya is currently retired and living near [[Fanewick]] 

It’s also good for some of you guys to have pre-existing relationships to one another. I’ll start you guys off in a way that pushes you all together, but it’ll make perfect sense if there were existing pairs etc.

# Daggerheart Rules
The whole rules PDF is [[here]], and the [[/Rules]] section has some of my own notes.

Please **don’t** read the ‘Witherwild’ section of the rules, (pages 254-257). The campaign uses elements from it, though it has wound up different enough that the guide would be a weird combo of spoilers and confusing misinformation. The info that matters on this site.

Hello – this is both the main place. It will grow and evolve with the campaign. 

Assuming I haven’t messed anything up, everything visible on this site right now is reasonable for a player character to know. 
# Using this site
The best way to look for things is using the site-search – open it up with command+K/control+K and type what you’re looking for.

I’ve turned on comment sections – if you want to use that to leave your own extra info to characters/locations/etc, feel free.

# Setting
The campaign will begin with its focus on [[Fanewick]] and the nearby area.

There are various other locations established in the world, where your character might be from:
* [[Haven]] – a large city
* [[Katar]] – a township in the western savanna where most [[Katari]] in the region live.
* [[Magovi]] – a swap township
* Antozen – a semi
* [[Fulgon]] – A mountainous tundra (sort of) at the base of the 
* Brazenfields – a large region of farmland that primarily serves to feed the people of Haven
* 

Various other townships and hamlets exist on the map, but

# Backstory
We’re starting at level one, so the character’s story need not reflect a *huge* amount of prior adventuring experience. I’m looking for either fledgling adventurers, *or* unlikely heroes.  but should suggest a motivation for it. 

This is particularly true if your character is established to be *from* [[Fanewick]], since the region will be challenging *despite* it being local.

# Relationships
[[Vinaeya Starfen]] grew up in [[Haven]], and served much of her life as an ambassador to [[Fanewick]] - she has recently retired from that role, and continues to live in her bungalow near [[Fanewick]].

I’d like the PCs

It’s also good for some of you guys to have pre-existing relationships to one another. I’ll start you guys off in a way that pushes you all together, but it’ll make perfect sense if there were existing pairs etc.

# Daggerheart Rules
The whole rules PDF is [[here]], and the [[/Rules]] section has some of my own notes.

Please **don’t** read the ‘Witherwild’ section of the rules, (pages 254-257). The campaign uses elements from it, though it has wound up different enough that the guide would be a weird combo of spoilers and confusing misinformation. The info that matters on this site.

# Using This Site
The best way to look for things is using the site-search â€“ open it up with command+K/control+K and type what youâ€™re looking for. It is kind of garbage on phones though.

If you have info to add to a page, leave a comment. (Note â€“Â if it's in your character sheet or journal in Demiplane, it doesn't need to be on your character page; this stuff is mostly for me. Due to [fun rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) I can't embed the character sheets in here ðŸ˜”.

> [!attention]
> Please *donâ€™t* browse the code. I have hidden my secrets in a fairly rudimentary way. Also if you ever see some out of place percentage signs it probably means I messed up and you can see stuff I was hiding.

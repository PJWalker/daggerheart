# Using this site
The best way to look for things is using the site-search – open it up with command+K/control+K and type what you’re looking for. It is kind of garbage on phones though.

I’ve turned on comment sections – if you want to use that to leave your own extra info to characters/locations/etc, feel free.

> The comments are powered by GitHub, and can take you over to that site. Please *don’t* browse the code over there – it includes all my ‘secret’ notes.

# Daggerheart Rules
The whole rules PDF is [[here]], and the [[/Rules]] section has some of my own notes.

Please **don’t** read the ‘Witherwild’ section of the rules, (pages 254-257). The campaign uses elements from it, though it has wound up different enough that the guide would be a weird combination of spoilers and confusing misinformation. The info that matters will be on this site.

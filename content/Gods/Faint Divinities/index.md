[[Gods/Faint Divinities/index|Faint Divinities]] wander the land as incarnate beings, residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and small villages. As such, they are generally present in [[Fanewick|Wickans]]’ lives. Many communities, and even some larger families, even have their own small god, or tutelary spirit, that watches over them.

Belief and worship take on a different meaning here and there is a constant push and pull between the goals of both people and their dietic neighbours. The gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in the Fanewick. 

The various divinities of the Fanewick each have their own opinion on what is happening in regards to [[The Witherwild|the Witherwild]]. While some enjoy nature’s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance the Fanewick has become. While their behaviour and motives may be inscrutable, they are more accessible than gods that watch down from on high.

Gods are 100% real.

Within the [[Mortal Realm]], [[Gods/Faint Divinities/index]] are materially present and their influence is demonstrable to all. You could deny the existence of some gods, but Atheism would be an insane stance.

Practitioners of magic are also able to connect with the [[Hallows Above]] & the [[Circles Below]], and interact with the [[New Gods]], and the Fallen Gods respectively.

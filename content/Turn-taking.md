I can’t force you to totally change your ingrained communication styles, but what I would recommend aiming for is:
- Interrupt *me* whenever you have something to ask or do. Don’t wait for *me* to finish.
- Similarly, I’ll interrupt you if I have information that affects what you’re trying. 
- But – Don’t interrupt each other.

People are gathered, everyone seems more interested in making sure the body is dead
As you go past, you get a message from [[Vinaeya Starfen]], delivered by a masked figure, establishing that she isnâ€™t dead. 

The body appears real, but particularly strong instincts may detect that it is an illusion; especially if they attempt to touch the body.

Some NPCs will bond over this, and establish their locations.

A group of [[Haven Emissaries]] is there, though they seem more interested in verifying that she is indeed dead.

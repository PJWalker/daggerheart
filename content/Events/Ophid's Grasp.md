A plague sweeping across Haven, Ophid's Grasp spares no one, and grants all a painful end. 

In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust. Then a scaly rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern. Not long after, victim’s bodies will begin to harden, from their flesh, soft tissue, bones, and finally their organs will cease to function and solidify. The final stages of the serpent’s wrath is so quick, that many transform into statues where they stand.

Since the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop the spread of Ophid's Grasp.

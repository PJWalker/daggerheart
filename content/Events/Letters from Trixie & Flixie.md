  Flixie & Trixie were tasked with sending out letters to the party, to invite them to meet her.

  Flixie quickly sent out some relatively straightforward messages about the party, with a *hint* that the [[Funeral]] neednâ€™t get in the way of the plans.

Trixieâ€¦Â wasted a lot of time trying to make the messages â€˜funâ€™â€¦ which meant [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] had already â€˜diedâ€™ before she sent them out. Which meant she needed to be even *more* careful about hiding the messages.

***

As you may have heard, Vinaeya Starfen has passed, gracefully as ever, into the Hallows Above.
Let us come together this coming Lildei at Aestia Falls, to celebrate a lifetime of honesty and integrity.
In her honour, we shall share stories of how she touched our lives; and offerings to Ikla to ensure her safe passage.Â 
Vinaeya was many things; a mayor; a mother; a diplomat â€“Â but most of all, she was a force for unity and goodness.
Even in death, she would want us to join together with those around us, not just to grieve, but to continue her legacy.

â€” Trixie ðŸ’–

Hi â€“Â Iâ€™m throwing a party! But *shhh*, itâ€™s a secret.
Even though itâ€™s been ages, Iâ€™m sure you remember where we (???). Thatâ€™s where the party is!
Letâ€™s keep it intimate â€“Â no plus ones allowed. But Iâ€™m youâ€™ll make a bunch of friends once youâ€™re here.
Please bring this letter to my place next Lildei, so we know youâ€™re invited.Â 
â€” Flixie ðŸ’–

A woman whom Ikla did make, with
Love & kindness to fill any lake
I havenâ€™t stopped crying since
Vinaeyaâ€™s dying
Estiaâ€™s where weâ€™ll hold her wake

Dear,

Vinaeya is *dying* to see you again â€“ so weâ€™re throwing a party!
Given recent disturbances, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll understand the need to keep things discreet. That means no blabbing â€“ and sadly no plus-ones allowed â€“ but weâ€™re not going to let those Havenites stop us from having fun!

We hope youâ€™ll find many new friends among our special guests.

Come meet us at the bungalow as [[Rohkin - The Wandering Horn|Rohkina]] sets on 6-91 .
Keep this letter!Â The only way in is with a letter from me (or Trixie) ðŸ˜Š

â€” Flixie ðŸ’–

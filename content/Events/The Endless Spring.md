[[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] has shepherded in the seasons since time immemorial. But [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] has gone quiet; 

Fall hasn’t happened for ~50 cycles. 

> [!gm] Why the endless spring?
It’s because, under the guidance of [[Archmage Phylax]], the Haven army stole the Reaping Eye from [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons]]. This prevented her from ushering in the fall.

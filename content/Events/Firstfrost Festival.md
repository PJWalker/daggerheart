The people of Hush are currently celebrating the Firstfrost Festival.

The name suggests it’s meant to mark when the first crystals of ice form in the fields, but, as everyone here is well aware, winter hasn’t come for the past 3 cycles. 

You can surmise that the people here have decided its time for some fun regardless of the weather.

There is an arm wrestling competition, a stone-painting class, and a small marketplace full of homemade trinkets.

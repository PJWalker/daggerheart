A festival to celebrate the beginning of the cold season.

%%

The people of Fanewick are currently preparing for the Firstfrost Festival.

They’re putting up bunting of cyan and white.
A nearby bard is conjuring orbs of light that dance with his tune.

You see a tapestry depicting a great white owl flying over the lands, with a trail of sparkling icicles behind her. You can tell by the large, emerald eyes that this is [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons]] 

You  surmise that the people here are preparing for the Firstfrost festival. 

As the name suggests, it’s meant to mark when the first crystals of ice form in the forest, but, as you’re all well aware, the cold season hasn’t come to Fanewick for the past 3 cycles. You suppose they’ve decided it’s time for some fun regardless of the weather. 

There are arguments about when it should be.

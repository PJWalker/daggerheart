A corruption that is spreading throughout [[Fanewyck]]. Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, others claim is sprang from the bogs, but this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into “Withered” beings. Plants sprint to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws.

Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. When a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm, they are transformed.

They become a nightmarish hybrid of plant or beast, and their own changed body. The Witherwild will slowly replace the personality of victims with the same drive for consumption exhibited by the rest of the corrupt Fanewyck. Though the Withered may manage to retain a semblance of who they are for a time, eventually they’ll face the final loss of their personhood.

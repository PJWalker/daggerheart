**Conditions** are effects that grant specific benefits or drawbacks to the target they are attached to.

# Standard Conditions

Some features can apply special or unique conditions, which work as described in the feature text. Unless otherwise noted, the same condition can’t be applied more than once to the same target.

# Temporary Tags & Special Conditions

The **temporary** tag denotes a condition or effect that the affected creature can clear by making a move against it. When an affected PC makes a move to clear a temporary condition or effect, it normally requires a successful action roll using an appropriate trait. When an affected adversary makes a move to clear a temporary condition or effect, the GM puts the spotlight on the adversary and describes how they do it; this doesn’t require a roll but it does use up that adversary’s spotlight.

**Special conditions** are only cleared when specific requirements are met, such as completing a certain action or using a particular item. The requirements for clearing these conditions are stated in the text of the effect that applies the condition.

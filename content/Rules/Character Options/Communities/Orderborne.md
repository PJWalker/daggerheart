- What regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of foreign soil?
- What kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you in an hour of need? How did this change your view of the people of the Fanewick?
- You were charged with planting a rumour in a Fanewick community. What is it, and do you plan to carry out this mission?

Being part of an orderborne community means you’re from a collective that focuses on discipline or faith, and you uphold a set of principles that reflect your experience there. Orderborne are frequently some of the most powerful among the surrounding communities. By aligning the members of their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling bodies of these enclaves can mobilize larger populations with less effort. While orderborne communities take a variety of forms – some even profoundly pacifistic – perhaps the most feared are those that structure themselves around military prowess. In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries.

*Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.*

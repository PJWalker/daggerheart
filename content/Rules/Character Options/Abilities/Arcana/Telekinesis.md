Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Far range. On a success, you can use your mind to move them anywhere within Far range of their original position. You can throw the lifted target as an attack by making an additional Spellcast Roll against the second target youâ€™re trying to attack. On a success, deal `dice:12d4` physical damage to the second target using your Proficiency Die.

Sage is the domain of the natural world. Those who walk this path tap into the unfettered power of the earth and its creatures to unleash raw magic. Sage grants its adherents the vitality of a blooming flower and the ferocity of a ravenous predator. The Sage domain can be accessed by the [[Rules/Character Options/Classes/Druid/index|Druid]] and [[Rules/Character Options/Classes/Ranger/index|Ranger]] classes.

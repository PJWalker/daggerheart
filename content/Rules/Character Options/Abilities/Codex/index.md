Codex is the domain of intensive magical study. Those who seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on bodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge beyond the boundaries of common wisdom. The Codex domain can be accessed by the [[Rules/Character Options/Classes/Bard/index|Bard]] and [[Rules/Character Options/Classes/Wizard/index|Wizard]] classes.

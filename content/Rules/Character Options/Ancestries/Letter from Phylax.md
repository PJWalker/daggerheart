Dearest [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]],

Enclosed within this parcel is, at last, the first cultivated [[Manafold]] â€“ proof that our dreams were not in vain. 

When I saw its petal unfurl, I knew I should inform [[King Alexander Huberius|Huberius]] immediately, but the only one I wanted to share that moment with was you.

I realise my obsession drove me to ignore everything else - everyone else. You walked away from our partnership; and you didn't believe in me. 

For that, I forgive you.

May this Manafold remind you of all we once achieved and, if you will it, of all we can achieve together. For it seems that even the most scorched of earth, may blossom again.

With hope renewed,  
[[Phylax]]

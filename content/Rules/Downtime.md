Between conflicts, the party can take a **rest** to recover expended resources and deepen their bonds. During a rest, each PC can make up to two downtime moves.

When the party rests, they must choose between a short rest and a long rest. If a party takes three short rests in a row, their next rest must be a long rest.

If a **short rest** is interrupted, such as by an adversary’s attack, the characters don’t gain its benefits. If a **long rest** is interrupted, the characters only gain the benefits of a short rest.

A **short rest** lasts enough time for the party to catch its breath, about an hour in-world. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):

- **Tend to Wounds:** Clear 1d4+Tier Hit Points for yourself or an ally.
- **Clear Stress:** Clear 1d4+Tier Stress.
- **Repair Armor:** Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots from your or an ally’s armor.
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.

**At the end of a short rest,** any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest expire.

A **long rest** is when the characters make camp and relax or sleep for several in-game hours. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):

- **Tend to All Wounds:** Clear all Hit Points for yourself or an ally.
- **Clear All Stress:** Clear all Stress.
- **Repair All Armor:** Clear all Armor Slots from your or an ally’s armor.
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.
- **Work on a Project:** With GM approval, a PC may pursue a long-term project, such as deciphering an ancient text or crafting a new weapon. The first time they start a new project, assign it a countdown. Each time a PC makes the Work on a Project move, they either advance their project’s countdown automatically or make an action roll to advance it (GM’s choice).

At the end of a long rest, any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest or per long rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest or until your next long rest expire.

# Downtime Consequences

On a short rest, the GM gains `dice:1d4` Fear.
On a long rest, they gain Fear equal to `dice:1d4` + the number of PCs, and they can advance a **long-term countdown** of their choice.

# Using Downtime

Use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.

Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved.

# Projects during Downtime

The Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long-term endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.

These projects are typically tracked using a Progress Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story.

Simple projects advance their countdown each time a player uses the Work on a Project move, but complex projects require a roll.

# Extended Downtime

When you fast-forward the story across an extended period, use montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and advance any long-term countdowns as appropriate.

Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have **line of sight** to their intended target to make an attack roll. If a partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the target has **cover**. Attacks made through cover are rolled with disadvantage. If the obstruction is total, there is no line of sight.

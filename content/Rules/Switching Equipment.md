# Weapons
When your character is in a dangerous situation, you can mark a Stress to equip an Inventory Weapon, moving their previous Active Weapon into the Inventory Weapon section. If your character is in a calm situation or preparing during a rest, they can swap weapons with no Stress cost.
# Armor
Your character can’t equip armor while in danger or under pressure. Otherwise, they can equip armor freely, replacing their previous active armor with armor they’ve purchased or otherwise acquired. Each armor has its own Armor Slots, as recorded in the boxes in that section; if your character switches armor, be sure to keep track of how many Armor Slots you’ve marked on the old armor, especially if you are giving it to a party member. You can’t carry additional armor in your inventory. When your character switches armor, be sure to add their current level to its base damage thresholds and incorporate any bonuses they might have from other features.

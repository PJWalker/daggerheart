If you choose to avoid death, you might take a **scar**. If you do, cross out one of your Hope slots. You can’t use this slot anymore.

This may represent a physical scar, a painful memory, or a deep fear.

Scars are permanent. If you would ever cross out your last Hope slot, your character’s journey comes to an end.

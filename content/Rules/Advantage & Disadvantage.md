Based on your features, aid from your allies, or other effects, you may be granted advantage or disadvantage on an action or reaction.

* Advantage represents an opportunity, through either magical or mundane means, that you seize upon to increase your chances of success. When you roll with advantage, you add a d6 advantage die to your total.

* Disadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship, or challenge you face when attempting an action. When you roll with disadvantage, you subtract a d6 disadvantage die from your total.

You canâ€™t have both advantage and disadvantage on the same roll. Each source of advantage cancels out a disadvantage, and vice versa.

> [!example] 
> If you are at disadvantage due to being in a cloud of gas; but an ally grants advantage by helping you with your action, you roll as normal.

If you still have multiple sources of advantage or disadvantage, roll a d6 for each, and add the *highest* value to your total.

> [!Example] 
> If you try to convince a shopkeeper to give you a discount, and your party of 4 *all* help you with this, *each* of them roll a D6, and you add the *highest* result to your Action roll.

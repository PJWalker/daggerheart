Evasion represents a character’s ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a Difficulty equal to the target’s Evasion. A PC’s base Evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.

> [!dnd]- For D&D players
> Evasion is mechanically the same as D&D’s AC.
> But in daggerheart, [[armour]] is another separate thing.

> [!NOTE] Adversaries don’t have Evasion. Attacks against adversaries use the adversary’s *Difficulty*.

When an enemy attacks, they’ll make an attack roll.

If the result is less than your [[Evasion Score]], you dodge the attack. Otherwise, they’ll roll damage, and you’ll get the incoming damage number.

You may then choose to use Armour slots to reduce the incoming damage. For each slot you spend, reduce the incoming damage by your Armour Score.

Then, if the remaining damage is:
* at or above your severe damage threshold: lose 3HP
* at or above your Major [[Damage Threshold]]: lose 2HP
* zero or more: lose 1HP.

If you mark your last hit point, you’re immediately dying.

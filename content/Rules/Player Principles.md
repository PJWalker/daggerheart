# Build the World Together
Everyone is a storyteller, not just the GM. Advocate for the story beats you want to see, offer suggestions to enrich the arcs of the other player characters, flesh out the world, and establish your character's motivations.
## The map is not the territory
My general style has the characters *always* on a map of some sort, and I try to put relevant details on there. If you see a detail on a map I haven’t described, feel free to call attention to it. 

On the other hand, while I rest more on the maps that than average campaign, they *are not* the ground truth. If there’s something you want to interact with that makes sense but *isn’t* shown on the map, feel free to suggest it. 

# Play Your Character; Show Their Journey
Discover who they are through play, and let yourself be surprised by where their journey leads. Embrace their failures with the same vigour as you celebrate victories.

The whole game is imagination – when you pull yourself *out* of the character to analyse your options, you’re essentially playing your sub-game to the exclusion of other players. It

Push your character’s story forward by making strong, interesting choices. Find ways to show off what your character does best and what they do worst. 
# Spotlight Your Allies
Look for opportunities to highlight other characters.
Build relationships within the party, and to other NPCs.

Set your allies up to make a move they do well, ask them for help, or invite them to elaborate on an experience. 

## Unsolicited Advice
Be… real fucking careful with this.

EG: 
* I’ll cast
* ff
* *At this point* it’d be helpful to suggest casting aid on the other guy instead.

# Play with your Party
Pay attention to the other players and help to ensure everyone has their moments to shine. Highlight the different characters’ strengths and perspectives.

# Group checks
This will be the case whether you jump in proactively, or reactively.
(IE - we’re not having everyone roll the same task separately when the outcome is shared.)

## Conflict
Characters from having differing priorities and perspectives. Players should ensure their characters are committed to party cohesion, but nonetheless it may sometimes make sense for one character to act ‘against’ another – either intentionally or unintentionally.

When this scenario occurs, I’ll give the other player gets the choice of whether it works. With that said, I’d recommend:

* Start character conflict only if you’re happy to lose it.
* Make 100% sure the conflict is borne out of character, not from you as a player.
* Even if it is, take a moment to consider whether conflict is *constructive* to the relationship between the characters. 

# Address the Characters
Speak as your character, to the other characters. Use your connections, ask questions, and create a story using your conversations as well as your actions. 

Use out-of-character conversation when you need clarity, want to coordinate big moments, or check what excites the table. But when possible, let the story unfold through in-character dialogue.

# Be open
Express what you’re intentions are to me and to other players. If you’re not sure if something mechanically works the way you want, *still* confidently express your intentions, and we’ll figure out the best way to express that intent.

I’m not going to pull a *gotcha*, ignore your intentions and let you waste your abilities just because we’re not on the same page about how the world works.

1. I am almost always going to be talking in-character for relevant parts of conversations. 
2. I will try to *proactively* give you the background information you need to have a direct (in character) conversation with relevant parties. But please feel free to *ask* if you know things about the world. Just because I haven’t said it, doesn’t mean you don’t know it.
3. I try to keep things either *wholly concrete*, or *wholly abstract*. The middle ground is rare. Daggerheart frames a similar thing as ‘Scenes & Montages’. 

# Scenes & Montages
This describes me DMing D&D, but it’s also just the recommended style in DH. (Yay validation!)

We’ll basically be flipping between narrating things in concrete detail; and glossing over potentially hours/days/weeks in moments. If I’m skipping over a moment you have more detailed ideas for, please pull me up.

You *can* go the other way, but at some level I’m moving into ‘scene’ mode because I intend it to be interesting – and that may be due to things you don’t yet know about. The main way this is likely to come up (I think) is that if I’m having a conversation with you, and in the moment you as a player are not sure how your character would navigate it, feel free to pull away from ‘In person conversation’ and let me know what your goal for the conversation is.

# Maps
My intention is for every ‘scene’ to have a map, and every NPC and important object to have a token. And that includes improvised things. 

OTOH, I am 100% *not* going to be making my own map for every single map in the campaign. And I’m not going to have a single source that creates every single local/biome that I’m looking for.

Don’t read too much into any art-style incoherence.

## Minor exception
In populated areas, You’ll notice a bunch of faceless NPCs with light outlines. These are ‘interchangable’ in a way all the others arent’. Feel free to talk to them – they’ll may have opinions on whatever’s going on, and depending on your interactions I might ‘promote’ them into individuality. But… jesus christ don’t try to talk to each individual one.


# [[My Style]] 

Somewhere between what this video calls ‘’ ‘the cool cousin’

# Abstractions
Most of my tokens are in that same cartoony style
You’ll also see some faceless humanoid figures with light outlines. These are sort of an abstraction for there just generally being people here. At some level I guess it doesn’t make a huge difference to how you interact with them, but - in case

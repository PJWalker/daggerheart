Short humanoids with square features, dense musculature, and thick hair. Their average height ranges from 4 feet to 5 Â½ feet, and they are often quite broad in proportion to their stature. Due to a higher amount of keratin in their skin and nails, both are very resilient, and dwarves are known to decorate their bodies with a number of tattoos, unique piercings, and embedded gemstones. Equally, their hair grows thickly, primarily on their head, but across other portions of their body as well, and dwarves of all genders are known to wear facial hair, which may be styled in many intricate patterns. Typically, dwarves live up to 250 years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.

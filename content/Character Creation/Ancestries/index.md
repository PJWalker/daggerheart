All ancestries are present in this setting, but there are trends. (EG [[Katar]] is mostly filled with [[Katari]].) Check the specific pages below for more info.

It‘s free to have an ‘exceptional’ ancestry, but consider how that may have come about, and how that has impacted your character. 

If you have a specific idea that isn’t captured in the available classes, we can have a chat about making it happen.

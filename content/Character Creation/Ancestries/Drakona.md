# General Info
Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful elemental breath. All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armour against both the forces of nature and attacks. They are large in size (ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average) with equally large and naturally sharp teeth. Drakona perpetually grow their teeth throughout their approximately 350-year lifespan, so members of this ancestry are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona do not have wings and cannot fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry each possess elemental breath, the type of which is passed down through the generations of each drakona family.

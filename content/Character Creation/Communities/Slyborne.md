Slyborne [[Haven|Havenites]] might come from rebel groups of [[Fanewick]] seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. Depending on the nature of the tactics they employ, a character’s association with their Slyborne community might align with, or go against their upbringing.

* Who among the Haven army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why?
* You joined an insurgent group that’s working to free this land from Haven’s grasp. What has given you doubts about the leadership’s methods?
* Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?

The wealthiest [[Haven|Havenites]] are the Highborne, having inherited riches that were built over generations in the walled city. While they are more insulated from Ophid's Grasp, they are not immune.

* Who have you lost to [[Ophid's Grasp]]? How did it affect you?
* How did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected or embraced their core set of ethics?
* You grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from learning something about the world. What was this knowledge and when did you discover it?

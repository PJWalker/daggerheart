# Distances
On a VTT, IMO the most straightforward thing is to just use euclidean distance. In the interest of just letting pathfinder rules work if you’re using them, I’ll set the distances ever so slightly longer than the grid size:

1. [[Melee]]: 7ft (ie: touching squares, including diagonals)
2. [[Very Close]]: 16ft (or 2 squares, including diagonals) 
3. [[Close]]: 30ft 
4. [[Far]]: 60ft 
5. [[Very Far]]: 120ft 

This is effectively the same as the Pathfinder/3.5e ‘alternating diagonal’ rule – but I don’t think there’s a good reason to make things snap to a grid.

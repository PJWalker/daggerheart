# Euclidean Distances
We’re using euclidean distances, centre to centre. 

Within owlbear, double-tapping m gives you the ‘movement’ tool, which shows you how far you’re moving. I’ll also have all the character distances on screen as the GM, and you’ll be able to bring them up too. 

> [!info]- The Third Dimension
> The intention is for the third dimension to be handled by getting disadvantage when a target is more than half the relevant range above/below you, but not counting it directly. If/when any of you guys get a means to fly, we might revisit that.

# Groups of Enemies
A ‘group’ is a 10ft circle.
# Hope / Fear rolls
With the way I’ve set up the VTT you can only get the duality dice as a package. If the rules say to roll just Hope, or just Fear – roll the standard blue D12.

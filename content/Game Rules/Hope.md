Hope can be used to take special actions & empower abilities. Players can generally hold up to **six** hope at a time, and can use it largely at will.

Hope Actions:

* Help an ally. When an ally is making an action roll you could feasibly help with; spend one Hope to describe how you help them, and add [[Advantage & Disadvantage]] to their result.
* Use an Experience: When you have a relevant experience, you can spend a hope to use it to boost an action.

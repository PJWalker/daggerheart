Some features let you affect a roll after the result has been totalled—such as the Seraph’s “[Prayer Dice](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/daggerheart/sources/core/classes#PrayerDice),” the Faerie’s “[Wings](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/daggerheart/sources/core/ancestries#AncestryFeature),” or the Grace domain’s “Endless Charisma” 

In this case, you use it after the GM declares if the roll succeeds or fails, but before the narrative consequences unfold (such as damage being rolled) or another dice roll is made.

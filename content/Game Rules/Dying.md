If you mark your last HP, you must make a dying action.

> [!dnd] Unlike D&D, this all happens immediately

You can choose to either:
1. **Avoid death**. Remain unconscious. Roll a D12. If its value is less than your level, permanently lose 1 hope slot.  (ie gain a scar)
2. **Risk it all**, rolling your duality dice, passing on if Fear>Hope.
   If Hope>Fear, clear HP or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die.
   If you Crit, clear all HP & Stress
3. Go out in a **blaze of glory**, taking one action that automatically crits, and passing on.

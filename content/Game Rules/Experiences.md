## Experiences are always There
You can invoke your experiences for bonuses, but even when that’s not happening, they still effect the narrative. 


> [!dnd]- D&D Players
> * Daggerheart’s experiences most resemble Skill Proficiencies in D&D, except that each player defines their character’s experiences, and are mostly responsible for figuring out when they are relevant to a situation.
> * There are no experience points in Daggerheart, levelling is entirely milestone based.

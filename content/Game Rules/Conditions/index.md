title: Conditions
---
Some features impose a condition on your character (or an adversary). These are effects that grant specific benefits or drawbacks to the target they are applied to. Unless otherwise noted, the same condition canâ€™t be stacked on one target.

Most conditions are *temporary*, meaning they can be cleared via an action with a difficulty determined by the GM.

*Special* conditions will have specific requirements to be cleared.

Your [[Armor Score]] represent the maximum number of Armor Slots you may use.

This score is the sum of your armor’s base score, plus any permanent bonuses your character has from other abilities. 

When your character takes damage, you can mark one **Armor Slot** to reduce the severity of the damage by one threshold:
- **Severe → Major**
- **Major → Minor**
- **Minor → None**

You may only mark one Armor Slot per attack.

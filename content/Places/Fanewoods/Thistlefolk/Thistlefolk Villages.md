Though functionally invisible to outsiders, the villages within the bramble are vibrant, sprawling, and eclectic.

The mudstone walls holding back the dangerous thorns are typically painted with abstract strokes of green to camouflage the villages from any passersby who might notice them. Within, the buildings and walkways are typically painted in bright hues and large murals and lit by bioluminescent moss. When not armored for traveling out into the open forest, most of the Thistlefolk dress in a similar artistic fashion, with self-dyed and sewn garments. An abandoned Thistlefolk village near Hush was discovered after a large fire cleared some of the thicket that it was hidden within.

It has since been co-opted as a local hangout for the young people of Hush when they want to get away from their elders.

Most Commonly Sighted: In the underbrush and bramble, off-trail.

Misconception: They are a rogue band of anarchists and criminals.

The Thistlefolk take up residence in the place where nobody else dares—within the thickest, thorniest bramble of the Fanewoods. They are known for wearing armored clothing made up of thousands of tiny polished stones that have been cut to fit together seamlessly, like scales. This attire allows them to move through the barbed thickets without being caught up in its tangle.

Because the only Thistlefolk who emerge from the seclusion of their hidden villages are often thieves coming out to steal goods from unwitting travelers or sleeping merchants, they have received a reputation for being a syndicate of criminals.

In actuality, most of the Thistlefolk are quite peaceful and vulnerable, choosing to live within the safety of the bramble for their own protection from the large predator species who stalk the woods looking for an easy meal.

# Principles
- Insular
- Reserved
- Focused on preserving the safety of their home

Those who leave the bramble’s protection are viewed by some as brave, and others as foolish.

- *The thorns only catch those who let them*
- *Look over your shoulder - you never know who you are leading home*
- *Combat the darkness of the world outside, with the brightness of life within*

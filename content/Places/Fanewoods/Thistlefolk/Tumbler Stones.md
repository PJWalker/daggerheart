When approaching the tangles of thorny vines that grow along the shoreline of the Lucent River, it is not uncommon to hear an ominous rattling coming from within. Though this scares many inexperienced travellers who might think it’s a creature of some sort warning them to stay away, in fact, the sound derives from the stone tumblers built by the Thistlefolk. They utilize the water’s powerful current to tumble stones in the sediment of the river’s edge until they are as smooth as glass. Thistlefolk must brave the less dense underbrush to retrieve the stones, which can be cut and placed into their specialized armor. The lapidary of each village is responsible for choosing and then cutting the stones that go into the tumblers. 

They are said to have hands so densely calloused that they could catch the edge of a sword in their palm without bleeding.

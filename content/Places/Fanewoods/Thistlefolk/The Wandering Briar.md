A living thicket of briars estimated to be more than fifty feet tall, one hundred feet thick, and about a mile long, it crawls its way through the endless forests of Fanewoods, frequently blocking routes and forcing travellers to take a different pathway to their destination. This moving tangle also serves as a home for a group of traveling Thistlefolk who live within its ever-shifting walls, known as the Wanderers.

The Wanderers have learned that when the Wandering Briar draws blood with its thorns, it can absorb the blood to move at a more rapid pace. Clever poisoners may grind the thorns of the Wandering Briar and feed the powder to a target. It inhibits the clotting of blood, turning minor wounds into major injuries.

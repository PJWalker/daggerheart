A mountainous region to the northeast
- Most [[Goblin|Goblins]], [[Inferis]], [[Giant|Giants]], [[Faun|Fauns]] and [[Drakona]] live here
- [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] & [[Orc|Orcs]] are also common.
- [[The Endless Spring]] means there’s no snow here

> [!question] Why are you coming down from the mountains *now*? It isn’t exactly looking great down here.

The Clover Tavern is a sight to behold, with six curving stories climbing the trunk of an ancient tree. This is the heart of the community, always crowded with music and good-natured conversation. Newcomers to the bar must take off their shoes and hang them over a line that stretches across the barâ€™s ground floor.

%% Inevitably, by the time visitors leave, their shoes will be shined and filled with small trinkets. %%

A great river that runs north/south from [[Fulgon]] to the [[Wandering Bay]]   and separates [[Fanewick]] and the [[Greenlily Bleach]]. Due to the large tidal effects, the river’s bank shifts substantially from east to west, and back, over the course of a dei. This has led to steep cliffs forming on the [[Greenlily Bleach]] side, while a more gradual incline on the [[Fanewick]] side creates a region of semi-aquatic marsh, home to many [[Ribbet|Ribbets]]  and [[Galapa]].

* The fuzzy border between Aestia and Fanewick houses most [[Ribbet|Ribbets]]  and [[Galapa]]

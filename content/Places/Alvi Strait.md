A strait the runs between Greenlily & Fanewick. 

Due to the large tidal effects, the river’s bank shifts substantially from east to west, and back, over the course of a cycle. 

This has led to steep cliffs forming on the [[Greenlily Bleach]] side, while a more gradual incline on the [[Fanewick]] side creates a region of semiaquatic marsh, home to many [[Ribbet|Ribbets]] and [[Galapa]].

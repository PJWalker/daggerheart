        
The land, sea, and sky, where mortals live out the entirety of their livesâ€”the plane where the majority of all material beings and objects exist. Stories say this realm was created by the [[Forgotten Gods]] during the [[Earliest Age]], and when they were overthrown by the [[New Gods]], many of these ancient deities were banished to remain here eternally. This realm is also occupied by the [[Gods/Faint Divinities/index]], the more common lesser deities created by both the Forgotten and the New Gods to oversee the Mortal Realm.

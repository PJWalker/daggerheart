The collection of realms where many of the gods reside, having been claimed by the [[New Gods]] at the end of the [[Earliest Age]]. Because this place is closely connected with most other realms, the gods that reside here can see and speak with the people of the Mortal Realm without leaving their domain, though their methods of communication may appear strange or obfuscated to those with whom they choose to engage. 

There are ways by which the gods can leave the Hallows Above to occupy other realms, but they must always sacrifice something of personal importance to do so. Itâ€™s rumoured that this sacrifice is the cause behind some of the great calamities that have befallen the Mortal Realm.

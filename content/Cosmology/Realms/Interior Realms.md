     
There are countless realms aside from the [[Material Realm]] & the [[Realms Above]].

These are not well understood by the people of the Mortal Realm, though mages have attempted to investigate them via their interaction with the strings.

The [[Maniflower]] appears to have a connection to one or more of these realms, amplifying vibrations in the [[Material Realm]] in surprising and powerful ways. Recent advances in our understanding of these effects by those within [[The Circle]] have enabled the creation of heretofore unimaginable technologies that put the power of mages into the hands of the lay person.

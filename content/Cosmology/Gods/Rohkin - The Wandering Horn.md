Rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in the [[Fanewick]].

In happier times he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of [[The Witherwild|the Witherwild]] has taken hold he’s seen his herds change into unrecognisable, dangerous beasts.

The ‘moon’ Rohkina is named after him.

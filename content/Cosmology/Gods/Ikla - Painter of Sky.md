Ikla’s artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each sunrise and sunset over [[Fanewick]] in a myriad of scintillating colours. The rest of the time they could not be lazier and their demeanour is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favour of them during their time off.

 The nearby star Iklata is named after them, as is the day Iklalil, and Ikla’s Vines.

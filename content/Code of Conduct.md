In Daggerheart, you and your fellow players all take turns describing what your characters do. The GM determines the consequences of those actions, then guides the group into collaboratively evolving the narrative because of those consequences. When the rules call for it, or when a situation demands, you’ll roll the dice to inform what happens next. Depending on the result of the roll, the events of the ongoing story will unfold in new and unexpected ways.

There is no winning or losing in Daggerheart in the traditional “gaming” sense. The game is a collaborative storytelling experience, where the goal is to play out an incredible story together. Even if the characters fail to achieve their goals right away, make big mistakes, or even die, they never “lose.” If a character dies, the party can look for a way to bring them back to life, or that player can make a new character for the party to meet along their journey. If the group fails to stop the villain from enacting a terrible plan, they might face the consequences of that failure and try to make it right. If they succeed, they may triumphantly win the day—or they might anger or embolden an even stronger enemy who retaliates. No matter what happens during the story, as long as you’re working together to craft a narrative that is fun and exciting to everyone, you’ve already won.

# Be Cooperative
## Cooperate as a Character
If your character would realistically choose to leave the party, or wouldn’t be welcome to travel with the rest, then the story won’t follow them. 
### PvP
Daggerheart isn’t a PvP game. If you do take hostile action against another player, I’ll ask them how they want it to go. Don’t start a fight unless you’re happy to lose it. (And even then, use sparingly)

# Share the Spotlight
We have a mix of experience levels and social styles at the table.
- **Interrupting the GM is sometimes OK**  
    - If I’m setting up a scene and you want to do something, feel free to interrupt. You don’t need to wait for every detail before acting. 
    - If you want to use an effect that comes into play after a result is totalled (EG Prayer Dice) *please* interrupt me to do so, if I start to describe the effect.
    - I may also cut in when you’re speaking, if something needs clarifying. If I overdo it, let me know.
* **Avoid speaking over other players**
# Be Ready
* Get on discord by the session start time, or let us know ASAP if you’ll be late or unable to attend a session.
* Have [owlbear](http://owlbear.rodeo/) and your character sheet up and ready to go
# Be Considerate
We’ll have a bit of a chat on this to figure out where these things go. But even beyond then, if something makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to call a time-out, or to message me. 
## Veils 
Veils are topics that may come up, but will not be the focus of a scene.
* Sex
## Lines
Lines are topics that will not coming up at all.
* Sexual Violence
# Follow the Fun
## Take Fun Seriously
If you have an idea for something that’d be engaging if it happened… the best way to share that is to *do it.* The whole game is make believe – there’s no reason to follow a less interesting story just because it may a more advisable path.
# Be Aware
* Pay attention to what’s going on and jump in to describe how your character is acting. I’ll direct the conversation to specific players at times, but you shouldn’t be waiting for me to address you specifically
* Notes will wind up on https://pjwalker.github.io/daggerheart/ one way or another, but we can have a chat about people scribing or whatever else.
* If there’s something you want to remember, the comments on my site would be a good place to put a note. You’ll need a [github](https://github.com) account to leave a comment. 

# Embrace Danger
Don’t be afraid to leap in headfirst and think like a storyteller, asking what the hero of a novel or a TV show would do here? Think about not only what choice might be obvious, but what story could be most interesting, or how your character might approach the situation differently because of their background. Remember that you are not your character and that it’s okay to put them into harm’s way, push them to their limits, and take big risks if it’s right for the story. Their trials and their failures are not yours. We might always want to win, but players win by collaborating on a compelling narrative, not by having successful dice rolls every time.
# Use Your Resources
Player characters in Daggerheart have access to many resources that help them in their heroic journey. Chief among them is Hope, a resource that frequently comes and goes over the course of a session. You’ll gain a Hope roughly every other time you make an action roll, so you’re encouraged to spend it on Hope Features, to Help an Ally, to Utilize an Experience, to initiate a Tag Team Roll, and to use other features and abilities that cost Hope. Stress, Hit Points, and Armor are your most essential other resources. They interact in varying ways that you can manipulate and optimize with domain abilities, ancestry features, class features, and more. For players excited about the crunch of interacting mechanics, look to those resources and think about how to manage them to get the most out of your character.
# Tell the Story
You are an equal partner in telling the story alongside everyone else at the table. The GM presents opportunities and challenges for the party along the way, but they are not the sole author of the fiction you’re exploring together. Daggerheart is a collaborative game where everyone is responsible for bringing the tone, feel, and themes they’re interested in to the group. If you have an idea for a description or a detail to add, feel free to offer it to the table. If you want a specific emotional arc to be a part of your story, talk to your GM about finding opportunities to include it, and seize those opportunities when they show up. When you reach these moments in the story, take the time to showcase the emotions driving your character forward and the desires spurring their actions.

Your role as a player in Daggerheart is to guide your character along the best story arc you can, not necessarily to always make the most tactical or strategic moves. Think about what you’re interested in saying thematically with the narrative, and let that be expressed through your character.
# Discover your Character
It’s okay not to know everything about your character when you sit down to play for the first time, the tenth time, or even the hundredth time. When the game begins, you only have a few pieces of information to go on—such as what your character might be good at, some backstory, their relationships with a few other characters, and what kind of weapon they carry. That’s perfectly fine—because you’ll build on your character throughout the game. Think of character creation as an ongoing process.
The GM might turn to you to ask something about your past that you haven't worked out or thought of yet. You could take this opportunity to invent something on the spot, or ask them to talk through some ideas with you before you settle on one. Try to use the game’s fiction to discover the different aspects of your character, and let those discoveries flow into the decisions they make.

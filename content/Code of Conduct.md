# Be Cooperative
## Cooperate as a Character
If your character would realistically choose to leave the party, or wouldn’t be welcome to travel with the rest, then the story won’t follow them. 
### PvP
Daggerheart isn’t a PvP game. If you do take hostile action against another player, I’ll ask them how they want it to go. Don’t start a fight unless you’re happy to lose it. (And even then, use sparingly)

# Share the Spotlight
We have a mix of experience levels and social styles at the table.
- **Interrupting the GM is sometimes OK**  
    If I’m setting up a scene and you want to do something, feel free to interrupt. You don’t need to wait for every detail before acting. I may also cut in when you’re speaking, if something needs clarifying. If I overdo it, let me know.
* **Avoid speaking over other players**
# Be Ready
* Get on discord by the session start time, or let us know ASAP if you’ll be late or unable to attend a session.
* Have the VTT and your character sheet up and ready to go
# Be Considerate
We’ll have a bit of a chat on this to figure out where these things go. But even beyond then, if something makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to call a time-out, or to message me. 
## Veils 
Veils are topics that may come up, but will not be the focus of a scene.
* Sex
## Lines
Lines are topics that will not coming up at all.
* Sexual Violence
# Follow the Fun
# Be Aware
We can talk about having a scribe, but however things go, notes will wind up on https://pjwalker.github.io/daggerheart/ for reference. If you want to write a quick note about a character, leaving a comment on its page is a good way to do that. And leaving comments on the ‘session’ pages might be good too. I’ll try to publish articles about things as I introduce them, but the publishing process has a ~20s lag so it might not be there *immediately*.

In Daggerheart, you and your fellow players all take turns describing what your characters do. The GM determines the consequences of those actions, then guides the group into collaboratively evolving the narrative because of those consequences. When the rules call for it, or when a situation demands, you’ll roll the dice to inform what happens next. Depending on the result of the roll, the events of the ongoing story will unfold in new and unexpected ways.

There is no winning or losing in Daggerheart in the traditional “gaming” sense. The game is a collaborative storytelling experience, where the goal is to play out an incredible story together. Even if the characters fail to achieve their goals right away, make big mistakes, or even die, they never “lose.” If a character dies, the party can look for a way to bring them back to life, or that player can make a new character for the party to meet along their journey. If the group fails to stop the villain from enacting a terrible plan, they might face the consequences of that failure and try to make it right. If they succeed, they may triumphantly win the day—or they might anger or embolden an even stronger enemy who retaliates. No matter what happens during the story, as long as you’re working together to craft a narrative that is fun and exciting to everyone, you’ve already won.

# Be Cooperative
## Cooperate as a Character
If your character would realistically choose to leave the party, or wouldn’t be welcome to travel with the rest, then the story won’t follow them. 
### PvP
Daggerheart isn’t a PvP game. If you do take hostile action against another player, I’ll ask them how they want it to go. Don’t start a fight unless you’re happy to lose it. (And even then, use sparingly)

# Share the Spotlight
We have a mix of experience levels and social styles at the table.
- **Interrupting the GM is sometimes OK**  
    If I’m setting up a scene and you want to do something, feel free to interrupt. You don’t need to wait for every detail before acting. I may also cut in when you’re speaking, if something needs clarifying. If I overdo it, let me know.
* **Avoid speaking over other players**
# Be Ready
* Get on discord by the session start time, or let us know ASAP if you’ll be late or unable to attend a session.
* Have [owlbear](http://owlbear.rodeo/) and your character sheet up and ready to go
# Be Considerate
We’ll have a bit of a chat on this to figure out where these things go. But even beyond then, if something makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to call a time-out, or to message me. 
## Veils 
Veils are topics that may come up, but will not be the focus of a scene.
* Sex
## Lines
Lines are topics that will not coming up at all.
* Sexual Violence
# Follow the Fun
## Take Fun Seriously
If you have an idea for something that’d be engaging if it happened… the best way to share that is to *do it.* The whole game is make believe – there’s no reason to follow a less interesting story just because it may a more advisable path.
# Be Aware
* Pay attention to what’s going on and jump in to describe how your character is acting. I’ll direct the conversation to specific players at times, but you shouldn’t be waiting for me to address you specifically
* Notes will wind up on https://pjwalker.github.io/daggerheart/ one way or another, but we can have a chat about people scribing or whatever else.
* If there’s something you want to remember, the comments on my site would be a good place to put a note. You’ll need a [github](https://github.com) account to leave a comment.

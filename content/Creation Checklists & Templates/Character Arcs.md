# Positive Arc
## The Ghost
## The Lie
## The Want
Usually an external Desire
## The Need
What is the deeper thing 
## The Truth
The antidote to the truth. Usually either:
1. Something that recontextualises the want.
2. Something that establishes that the want is *not* the need, and pushes them to the need 

# Tragic Arc
## Start with Truth
## Introduce the Lie
## Character tempted by lie

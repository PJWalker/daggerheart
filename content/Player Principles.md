## Create the world together
Many of you will be local to the region, and all of you will be local to the world. Please feel free to improvise familiarity with the settings, objects, characters etc, and to embellish and add detail to them beyond what I’ve told you. Unless it ‘breaks’ something, I’ll ‘yes and’ it.

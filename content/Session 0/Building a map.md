If you know at character creation that you’ll be running a campaign, you can bring a blank map to your session zero to fill out together. Otherwise, you can always introduce it at the top of your next session to integrate into your game moving forward.

To start, place the map on the table and explain to the players that you’ll be using it to build the region together. Choose the name of the region from the options available (or make up your own) and write that name on the sheet. If you’re using a campaign frame, the name of the region is provided for you.

Next, remind the players about any locations they have already created for the setting. Pass the map around and have them label the locations they created anywhere they’d like.

Then, choose one of the locations from the list on the sheet and add it to the map. Describe this place for the rest of the table—what is it? Why is it called this? What makes it so significant? Then pass the map to another player to do the same. Encourage them to tie in their character’s backstory or history with the new location if they wish. As players describe the locations they’ve chosen, record any important information about them in your notes.

The map should continue around the table like this until it feels like it is populated with enough exciting locations and plot hooks for you to work with. With four players, twice around the table is usually enough. Remember, you can always do this again at the start of another session to fill out the map further, or even introduce a new region that connects to the current one.

After the table feels happy with the details they’ve added, take the map back and begin the adventure. Maybe it’s somewhere the players have already added, or maybe it’s a new place—either way, this will help you orient yourself for the campaign moving forward.

# Filling Space, Leaving Blanks

As part of the prep for your next session, you’ll want to review the map your table built together. Think about how the locations your players created might affect the region, and add anything you think might be important or relevant to the sheet. For example, if someone labeled a spot with “The Healing Fields,” you might consider adding a town nearby that specializes in creating 

Health Potions

 or curing ailments, or a mage’s tower that overlooks the fields to protect them. Pay attention to where the PCs currently are in their journey—where might they consider going next?

It’s also important to leave blanks. Don’t feel the need to fill everything in, and don’t worry about planning out what every labeled landmark or town is like. Leaving some things vague gives you the freedom to adapt on the fly and reduces the amount of worldbuilding work you have to do for places your players might never visit.

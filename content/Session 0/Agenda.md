# Introductions
# Daggerheart
Daggerheart aims to be a bit more narrative focussed, and in . Unlike D&D this whole session is is *almost mandatory*.
## Dice Basic
You’ll need to have some way of rolling 2 different coloured d12s. I’ve set up owlbear to have that option, but I don’t mind if you want to use the roller on demiplane, or use actual dice.

When your character does something consequential I’ll likely ask you to make an action roll. You’ll roll both, and add whatever the relevant trait is. I’ll usually tell you which one, but sometimes I’ll leave it to you.

# Gameplay Structure
- Do we want to use the spotlight tracker? I kind of think *no*, but also if there’s any time to do it, it’s at the start. The basic idea of it is to formalise a system to require roughly equal numbers of ‘turns’ per player. (If implemented as written, it basically requires ever)

Phylax studied the growth of these flowers and understood that the cyclical reaping was limiting their growth – [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] needed to be stopped. He had attempted to convince [[King Alexander Huberius]] of this, but he instead heeded [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]]’s warnings about the need for balance.

But when [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] research, [[Lord Regent Vasali]] was much easier to convince. So they arranged an expedition to [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] to get her onside.

Phylax is an extremely powerful [[Character Options/Classes/Wizard/index|wizard]], and together with the [[Haven Emissaries]] they were able to capture [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] and warp her vision such that her eye of sowing would gaze solely upon Haven. However, this meant her right eye was in turn fixed upon the mountain.

As she saw what she her gaze was causing, [[Nikta - Shepherd of Seasons|Nikta]] found a new burst of motivation to escape, but in the battle that ensued, her eye of reaping was split into three.

One of these fell into the [[The Crater]]. One remains secluded with [[Archmage Phylax]] in [[Places/Haven/index]]. The other is… somewhere else.

As the power of reaping ceased to be focused on [[Mount Iatus]], the eruption remained fixed atop & around the city as it cooled.

This brought Phylax to even greater acclaim within haven, as he claimed credit for the eruption from taking the city.

However, whether caused by the remaining portion of the eye of reaping, or simply due to the new shade atop the region, this new reality led to new difficulties in creating the magical bloom.

In the coming cycles, the blooms of the the flowers would wilt and decay, and the town was losing its ability to magically placate its populace. So they have begun to seek new pastures in the wilds. This has not always been peaceful.

When [[Vinaeya Starfen|Vinaeya]] heard news of these events from her, she knew that [[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]] would not have the self-awareness to and to retain balance with the forces of the wilds. She also knew that [[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]] would know that she would get in his way, and with the might of Haven on his side, she would not be able to simply confront him.

When her companions [[Trixie & Flixie Glitterwing]] encountered an attempt to infiltrate her home while she was away, she knew she’d need to take drastic measures to turn things around.

We wanna figure out if we’re going to fight the owl or help them find her eye

We start at the funeral, which [[Lord Regent Vasali]] attends. The funeral operators are confused by his presence – knowledge of the King’s absence is not yet widespread. His guards seem awkwardly interested in ensuring that She’s dead, and then he gets bored (Phylax just said we had to show up and make sure she’s dead; we did that; can we go home now?).

This probably gets invaded by some jungle monstrosities, which the players will help fight off. During that fight they might realise that the body is fake. Then, the others involved in faking the death will fill the characters in on more detail and encourage them, if they wish to stand against Phylax, to go to Vinaeya’s hideout in the middle of the Fane.

In doing so, they mention that the temple is to nikta, and within her domain, but that her presence has been feint recently. They try to convert the players.

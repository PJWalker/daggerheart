## **Features**

### ⚡ _**Relentless (2) – Passive:**_

The Tressym can be spotlighted up to two times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight it.

---

### 🌩️ _**Static Pulse – Passive:**_
When Raichi enters you; mark a stress.
Roll a strength (15) reaction or be **Dazed** (disadvantage on their next attack or action).

---

### ⚡ _**Skybolt Glare – Action:**_

Make an attack against one or more Glowing targets within Far range. Targets take `2d6+3` thunder damage and must make a Presence Reaction Roll. On a failure, they are **Deafened** until the end of their next turn (cannot benefit from verbal effects, spells, or commands).

---

### 🧨 _**Thunderburst – Reaction:**_

When the Tressym is dealt damage in Melee range, spend a Fear to unleash a shockwave. All creatures within Close range must make an Agility Reaction Roll or be **Blasted** (take `1d10` thunder damage and be pushed to Very Close range from the Tressym).

---

### 🌀 _**Charged Winds – Reaction:**_

When the Tressym would be hit by a ranged attack or spell, it may instead spend a Fear to generate a storm wall. The attack is deflected, and all creatures within Far range gain Disadvantage on ranged attacks until the end of the next GM turn.

---

### ✴️ _**Storm Presence – Passive:**_

The first time each round the Tressym successfully hits a PC, you gain a Fear.

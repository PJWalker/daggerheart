Rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in the [[Fanewick]].

In happier times, they preserved the balance of nature and civilisation, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of [[The Witherwild]] has taken hold, they has seen their herds change into unrecognisable, dangerous beasts.

The main satellite orbiting Hom, Rohkina, is named after them, as it is made of the same substance as their horns.

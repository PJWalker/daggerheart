Spectral Body — Resistant to physical damage

Memory Delve - Action: Make an attack roll against a close target. On success, the wraith flies into melee, and places its hand on the targets cheek. Ask the player to describe a terrifying moment from the character’s childhood. Then deal `dice:3d4+9` magic damage, and make them [[Player Rules/Conditions/Vulnerable]] until next rest

Pass-through - Action: **Spend a fear** & make a melee attack roll. On success, the wraith passes through the target, pushing their soul from their body momentarily, untethering it from their body. They cannot act again until the ritual countdown tick again.

If the entire party is untethered, they all mark 2HP and their souls return.

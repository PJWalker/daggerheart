The Sanctuary is an artificial holding area, 100 miles across, created by a nefarious scientist to house his critter experiments – both delightful and devious. Surrounded by a translucent blue force field, the Sanctuary features five different, artificially generated, biomes – the western forests, the southern tropics, the eastern grasslands, the frozen north, and the central wastes – each with their own towns and landmarks built by the various creatures that call this place home. Ruling over it all from a sulfurous citadel is the tyrannical Snuggles, created by splicing feline and red dragon DNA. *The locations are described from the perspective of the animal inhabitants.*

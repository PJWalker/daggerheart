You emerge into a world within a world: an underground… mountain? Around you, natural stone walls – some bearing carvings with a dwarven aesthetic – rise toward a craggy ceiling. Light stabs into the cavern from tower-high punctures above, the sunbeams supporting plant life in the swathes they touch on their daily sojourn across the floor. The space is quiet as a tomb, save for the water that runs in rivulets from bifurcated rectangular stone gates. These thin streams gather at a small lake in one quadrant of the cavern. The rest is dominated by the artificial mountain, perhaps modeled after some far-removed peak. In the half-light, you notice it is riddled with dwarf-sized doors, each one seemingly smashed open in a calamity lost to history.

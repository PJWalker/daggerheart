Verdant undergrowth falls beneath your blade, surrendering its long held secret: ancient stonework. The markings upon it are strange and uneven, as if scoured or burned into the stone rather than carved. Lush, wet moss fills the openings like living pigment, breathing vertiginous life into the time-worn artwork. As your gaze travels over the walls you realize that the people who created this temple worshippedâ€¦ unorthodox beings. Much of the temple wall is covered in depictions of bowing worshippers, prostrate before formless gelatinous deities.

Violet titans, their peaks shrouded in mist, cradle a fertile land covered in luxuriant foliage, vibrantly green from the frequent rains. Swathes of swampland and wide rivers extend vast distances, beginning and ending at the feet of the looming mountains. Farms flourish—flooded fields, tiered paddies, and grazing oxen with long horns—and magic abides in every corner of the land. Ancestors return to this plane as animal spirits; diminutive beings of wood and rock tend to the natural world; long and winding dragons fly among mountain peaks and along ancient rivers, their scales lunar-bright and their manes lush with leaves, or flame, or with flecks of silver and gold. Shrines to these mysteries abound, rising from the centers of lakes, spanning over rivers, nestling within jungle shrouds, or inhabiting cliffsides with wooden ramps that run between alcoves carved directly into the stone.

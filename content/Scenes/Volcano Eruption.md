The howling of dogs and a sudden flurry of bird wings are the only warning before the ground begins to buck and shake beneath your feet. The tremor jars people and animals alike, and you must fight to keep standing, as if you were on the deck of a ship in turbulent waters. With a deep rumbling, followed by a roar, the top of the mountain belches tons of burning ash and hot gases high into the sky. The shockwave pounds over you—so loud, and with such force, that you cannot hear those around you screaming. Even for such as you, the fury of the volcano is overpowering and terrifying, and you feel an immediate need to seek shelter—protection from the deadly ash and the burning chunks of liquid rock already spat into the firmament.

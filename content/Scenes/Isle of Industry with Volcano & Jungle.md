This city is built along black cliffs that line the sea’s edge. Ships of all sorts anchor on quays at the escarpment’s foot. Towers and other high buildings cut a jagged but majestic skyline, though smoke from the furnaces and forges billows into the sky from various points, along with the din of industry. A volcano, far away toward the isle’s center, dwarfs these plumes and the city’s dark structures. The metropolis stands on a broad plateau, girded in tropical greenery and bounded by ravines of black stone through which wild, narrow waterways flow. Similar tablelands surround the city, choked with jungle but separated by darksome chasms.

The sheer, crumbling cliffs of the plateau provide a harrowing climb, but you manage to scale the rocky rise. At its summit, you find a magnificent view of the wilderness, sprawling in all directions in an infinite, green expanse. Rivers vein the lush greenery, empty into lakes and swamps, and flow ever outward to seas beyond the horizon. Flocks of birds circle below, and even from this great height you see the jungle teems with abundant life. In the distance, you spy your prize: an airship, crashed among the boughs of a massive tree and held aloft by little more than tangled, knotted vines.

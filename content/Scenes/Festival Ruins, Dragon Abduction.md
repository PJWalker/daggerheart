You watch the image of the dragon dwindle, each flap of its wide moss-green wings taking your patron further and further away. Her screams fade to nothing, muted by the shrieking roar of her captor. You survey the wrecked town square, eerily quiet as shocked faces stand up from the rubble. The foul-smelling poison, spewed from the dragon’s throat as a noxious mist, has settled into pools along the ground. Bodies lie in the bubbling liquid, bloated and purple – dead or dying. Trembling townsfolk absently pick up the remnants of stalls – lengths of torn ribbon, planks of wood, soiled pennants – while the braver of the lot attempt to reach those writhing amid the poison. Wails of horror and pain begin to swell up from the crowd, shattering the silence.

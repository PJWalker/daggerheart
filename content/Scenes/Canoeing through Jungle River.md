As you gently float along the river, the jungle hums with hidden life all around you. The next time your paddle dips into the water, a pulse like a heartbeat reverberates up the handle. A harried whisper flits past your ears and the trees along the riverbank take on a new lifeâ€”each knot or curl in the wood becomes a feature of an ancient, arboreal face. From their roots, emerald-green energy flows into the river, quickening the current. The flux spurs your canoe forward with such force that the vessel rocks dangerously, nearly tipping over.

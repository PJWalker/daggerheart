The jungle around you teems with life, a vista of movement. Wind rustles the trees and creatures flee through the underbrush as you traverse the dense wilderness, hacking through vines and gnarled roots to clear a path. The heat and humidity are almost overwhelming, and you find yourself soaked with sweat despite the trees towering above you – hundreds of feet tall – branches so dense as to block out the daylight almost completely. In the distance, massive creatures move and howl, and strange and alluring plants block your line of sight.

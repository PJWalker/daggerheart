The jungle closes in around you, dense and dim and teeming with life. Strange, alluring plants in every imaginable color rustle in the fragrant, humid wind. The incessant buzzing of insects accompanies your trek, while howler monkeys hoot in the distance. You set out on your journey, following paths left by creatures dwelling in the shrub layer. But as the day wanes, you find yourself forced to hack through vines and gnarled roots. You sleep fitfully, sweating in the persistent heat and humidity, waking in the night to creatures prowling the outskirts of your camp. On the third day, you stumble into the path of a massive panther-like creature, and find yourself detouring leagues in the other direction. On the fifth day, you find yourself entangled in snaring vines and desperately hack your way through. The lack of sunlight, filtered and shaded by the impenetrable jungle canopy high above, begins to wear on you—you wonder if you’ll ever see the sun again.

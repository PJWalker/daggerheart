The impenetrable canopy of the jungle trees obscures the night sky. You make your way carefully through the twisting mass of vines, roots, and ferns, hearing the sounds of thriving animal life all around you. The chirps and trills of what sounds like hundreds of nocturnal insects create a constant buzz in the air. Above, you can hear the rustling of creatures as they jump from branch to branch. As you make your slow progress, you come upon a shaft of purplish light cutting through the pall of shadow â€“ and a fallen tree, its roots still covered in moist, dark soil. This break in the canopy allows a glimpse of the night sky: a tapestry of stars framing two moons. One, blue-tinged white with a soft glow. The other, like a searing-red sun meeting the horizon.

A solemn face, constructed of leaf and twig, hangs above the dais. Vines coil and fall around the face like thick strands of green, frayed hair. Growing things imbue the space with their presence, their smell. Weeds peek in through cracks in the walls. Great roots lift up tiles from the floor and burrow into pews. Branches descend through the roof and the windowpanes. But this sacred place is not abandoned. Priests in hemp robes, their feet stained with mud, tend to the wild growths like kindly parents.

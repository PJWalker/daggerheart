The jungle has been cut back here to create a perimeter around a complex of tombs. Centered among them is an imposing layered pyramid, each level rising like a step for a giant. The sides gleam, each bisected by a central ascent of carved steps for the priests. As you approach, the glint of ritual daggers in the sunlight draws your eye upward to the flattened top and its stone altar, mottled and stained. Twin blood gutters flank the stairway, baked brown by the sweltering sun.

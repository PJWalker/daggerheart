The path to the left from the circle of stones allows for the best view of the falls descending down two tiers of silvery-gray cliffs in a steamy froth, before ending in the pool below. A trail of red earth, surrounded by sprightly green grass, trees, and bright red mushroom caps, wraps around the glimmering pond fed by the waterfall. Scents of damp earth, wet stone, and ripe berries sweeten the air. You hear the croak of frogs, the happy hum of insect wings, and… a series of small rubbery noises. Scanning the grass around the lake, you spy some of the red and white-spotted mushroom caps wriggling, lively. With another elastic *squeak!* a mushroom hops out of the grass, revealing a small face set into the stalk just underneath the cap. Its shiny black eyes brim with curiosity and its squiggle of a mouth is upturned into a half-open smile—a look of childish glee. You hear their stalks squeak as they bounce along, following you.

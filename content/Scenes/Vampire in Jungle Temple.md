You stand amid bones and vines in the thick humidity of the jungle floor. The lower walls are covered in bas-reliefs of strange profiles with their tongues sticking out or wearing feathered headdresses. The ziggurat of stone blocks—moss collected in the cracks between them—looms like a seated god over the jungle. Many stairs lead upward to the priest’s alcove, and just inside the shade of its angled frame stands the vampire, a harrowing presence even from this distance. The undead figure turns and walks inside, and the jungle birds, silent until now, go back to their conversations.

A beam of pale sunlight streams in through the fogged window, illuminating a haze of dust motes floating in the air. The standard array of weaponry in the room is simple but well-maintained. Some lean laxly against weapons racks instead of being put away, secureâ€”this and the dust suggest peace has long been enjoyed by the people of the manor. A couple of spears sit snugly in a rack against a sunlit wall, a scabbarded sword and shield leaning against the frame. On the opposite wall, a quiver sits in shadow, as do a war axe and shield painted with stripes of white and blue.

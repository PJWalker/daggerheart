The wind cuts through your clothing like an icy blade, driving the rain with it, until you step into the warm embrace of an inn. You gratefully hang your sodden cloak on an empty hook near the entrance. The smell of freshly cooked food wafts through the almost empty taproom—the only patrons being a party of dwarves staring intently at a map spread out on one of the tables. Crunching across fresh reeds, you approach the bar and ask the fellow with braided hair if rooms are available. He puts down the tankard he’s polishing. “We should have one or two free.” He pulls over a leather-bound book. “A band of mercenaries checked out earlier today. It shouldn’t take long to make up their old rooms.” He takes a quill from beneath the bar and looks at you expectantly.

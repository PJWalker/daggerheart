Perhaps you wanted this to be a beautiful treehouse, but the god of wilderness has no need for that. The ancient oak is itself home. It agrees to the godâ€™s ritual climb into shade, where they breathe the unpolluted air of the old world together. He sits in the crook of broad branches to eat an acorn or whistle birdsong. The god sleeps for a brief moment to dream without bother or worry over those who come to cut and burn, until he must wake, unfurl his violent wings, and fly down to stand against civilization.

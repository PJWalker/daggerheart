A glare flickers from within the crystal, a massive orb wondrous in its size and beauty. It towers above the surrounding buildings and is set upon a quintet of golden claws, each bladelike and embossed with raylike patterns. The orb’s shell is translucent, with a burning source at its center. It glitters like a star and, as pink and white fires flare, patterns of rainbow color wash over the orb’s surface. A figure approaches the crystal, his hand held up to shield his eyes from its brilliant sear.

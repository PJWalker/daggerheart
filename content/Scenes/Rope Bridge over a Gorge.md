A thin suspension bridge over a yawning chasm connects the two cliffs, and even those who are not disposed to fear heights are given pause. Narrow planks have been placed end-to-end, attached by short lines to a pair of thick, sturdy hemp ropes – creating a V-shape – to aid in balance. Yet the wind at this high altitude keeps the rope bridge swinging to-and-fro, sometimes violently. Speculation about locals crossing the bridge regularly does little to assuage the creeping feeling of vertigo as you gaze downward despite your best efforts.

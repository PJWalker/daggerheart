The temple is a rounded tower—like a lighthouse. Walls of white stone and clear glass reveal adherents walking the curving halls within, who in turn can observe all those who approach the temple. Nothing is concealed from the god of foreknowledge. Inside, a tall statue of the god, robed and seated with knees akimbo, is illuminated by the light streaming down through the hollow tower. A third eye of clear glass is embedded in the god’s forehead, and an enormous glass orb rests in his lap, reflecting a dizzying view of the tower’s distant apex.

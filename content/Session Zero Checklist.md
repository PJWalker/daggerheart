Hello! Thanks for joining the game. Before we even think about the game, lets figure out if we can all even play at the same time.

## When are you available?
# Initial Commitment
I’d love if this turns into an ongoing campaign, but also maybe Daggerheart is terrible. 

I’m going to aim for a clear ‘stopping point’ within ~2-4 sessions, and then we can revisit what’s working and what isn’t before deciding if we want to keep going w/ daggerheart.

> [!Question] Are you interested in being in for the long haul?
## Session Time & Length

> [!Question] When are you free? How often do you want to play?

For me:
* I’d be able to make myself available on any of Tues-Saturday nights, though I’d rather not commit to Fridays. 
* I’d prefer a fortnightly cadence.
* I can generally start anywhere from 6:00, and don’t mind a late finish.

# Subject Matter
## Sexual Content
I don’t feel a need to ban it outright but I don’t expect it to come up, and if it does it is going ‘behind the veil’.
## Sexism & Gender Representation.
I am not intending to make a world where sexism is ‘true’. Whether any *characters* are sexist is something I’d be open to input on. I certainly don’t intend to dwell on it with major friendly NPCs, but, eg I have in a previous campaign made Orc society extremely patriarchal as one part of establishing why they’re the bad guys. But we don’t need things like that if you guys would rather not.

WRT representation, please give me a little leeway for having a bit of a male bias on minor NPCs; I’m trying to do distinct voices, and, well most of my options read masc.
## Racism & Ontological Alignment
There’s not going to be any racism against IRL human races. Duh.

In terms of judgement based on Ancestry, I think there’s more of a discussion to be had. Ultimately, we’re in a world with multiple dramatically different humanoid species. Some kinds of Speciesism are… just ‘correct’ as per the rules.

The main thing I’ll say here is, I am not going to involve any sort of ontological ‘alignment’. Orcs might be doing a bunch of evil things, but they’re not inherently, in-errantly evil.
## Classism
Again, we’re not making it correct.

Classism is practically baked into the [[Highborne]] community rules, and I am comfortable with this being a substantial theme. 
## Religion
As with the previous one, the rules indicate that gods objectively exist and directly interact with people. This is so far removed from religion in the real world that it almost doesn’t make sense to compare. Some of the rules mention gods, and I’m not going to change that, but is religious imagery / ritual / etc something people are happy to focus on or something that’ll only come up in passing?

# Player Behaviour
## Play *your* Character
In many situations, you’ll have an awareness of what the party is getting into – in those cases characters may strategise together *before* going into an encounter. But when you’re in the middle of combat, social encounter, etc – there’s no good reason to run each PC’s actions by a committee of all the players. Play your character, and let other players play theirs.

If you need help understanding something, feel free to ask, but make sure you’re *learning* rather than just taking the backseat. And if you’re answering, make sure you’re *explaining* rather than dictating.

If you have an idea for some tag-team or other team action, then feel free propose it to the other players involved – though you can often just *have* your character do its part.
## Play your *Character*
Your character has flaws and weaknesses, and it’s good to *see* those rather than just having the character disappear when they’re not perfect for the task at hand. 
## *Play* your Character
Your character sheet is a guide, not a straightjacket — follow what is fun for you. The most important element of your character is all the things they do *within* the campaign, and at pretty much any point you can make the ‘fun’ choice, and make it make sense after the fact.
In a similar vein to this… I may not take as much from the backstories as some GMs. I’m more interesting in playing with the plots and story elements that come up with everyone together than in forcing someone’s backstory to be relevant to everyone else. That’s not to say it isn’t possible, but… the inciting incident is happening *during the campaign*, it shouldn’t be part of some specific other quest you alone are working on.
## Share the Spotlight
Be mindful to balance ‘taking focus’ with giving focus to other players. Try to set each other up for success.
## Pet peeves
* Asking for rolls. Describe what you’re doing; it might not even need a roll!
## Predilections
* Split focus. **Please** split the party if there’s a good reason to do multiple things at once.

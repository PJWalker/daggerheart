Most Seaborne communities are in or near the river [[River Alvi]].
* You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What went terribly wrong on that passage and how has it changed you?
* Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did you learn and how when did it save your life?
* You used to sail with a companion. Who were they and how do you remain connected?

Most Seaborne communities are in or near the river [[Alvi Strait]].
- You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What went terribly wrong on that passage and how has it changed you?
- Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did you learn and how when did it save your life?
- You used to sail with a companion. Who were they and how do you remain connected?

Being part of a seaborne community means you lived on or near a large body of water. Seaborne communities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home. Some of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay down one’s head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass. No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are highly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation.

*Seaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered.*

Players might choose to build characters that come from one or neither country.

Many wanderborne have come to reside semi-permanently in Haven or [[Fanewick]], as safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military operations in the surrounds.

- What do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden?
- How have the recent restrictions affected you?
- Because of your communities’ transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion?
- Your community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?
# Character Creation
- Most characters from [[Greenlily Bleach]] are wanderborne, but they are common throughout other regions too.

Being part of a wanderborne community means you’ve lived as a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide variety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a religion or a set of political or economic values, others come together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the choice to continue down that road together mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering loyalty.

*Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful, reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.*

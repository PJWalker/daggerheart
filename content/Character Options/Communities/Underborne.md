Most underborne were raised in the deadly environment of [[Fanewick]], which has only become more dangerous as [[The Verdance|the Verdance]] progresses. Each has unique customs that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the territory of Faint Divinities, which may be freely shared, or closely guarded secrets.

 In exchange for protection from the Verdance, some have taken jobs as farmers in Havenâ€™s flower fields. Though it is back-breaking work, the Haven fires burn back the ever-creeping Verdance, offering safety.

# Character Creation
- Some residents of the [[Greenlily Bleach]] have dug permanent homes underneath the desert.
- Some [[Fanewick|wickans]] live within underground caves, but this is uncommon
- Many [[Fulgon|Fulgonites]]

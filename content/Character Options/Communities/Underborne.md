Most underborne were raised in the deadly environment of [[Fanewick]], which has only become more dangerous as [[The Verdance|the Verdance]] progresses. Each has unique customs that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the territory of Faint Divinities, which may be freely shared, or closely guarded secrets.

 In exchange for protection from the Verdance, some have taken jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields. Though it is back-breaking work, the Haven fires burn back the ever-creeping Verdance, offering safety.

Being part of an underborne community means you’re from a subterranean society. Many underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much deeper. These communities range in size from small groups in burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and skill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface.

*Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.*

Slyborne [[Places/Haven/index|Havenites]] might come from rebel groups of [[Fanewick]] seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. Depending on the nature of the tactics they employ, a character’s association with their Slyborne community might align with, or go against their upbringing.

- Who among the Haven army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why?
- You joined an insurgent group that’s working to free this land from Haven’s grasp. What has given you doubts about the leadership’s methods?
- Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?

Being part of a slyborne community means you come from a group that operates outside the law, including all manner of criminals, grifters, and con artists. Members of slyborne communities are brought together by their disparate goals and their clever means of achieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of unscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. To the outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty, but these communities possess some of the strictest codes of honor which, when broken, can result in a terrifying end for the transgressor.

*Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd, and tenacious.*

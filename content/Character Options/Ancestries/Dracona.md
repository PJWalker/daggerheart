![[Drakona-1747775753500.webp]]

Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful elemental breath. All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. They are large, ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp teeth. New teeth grow throughout a Drakona’s approximately 350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don’t have wings and can’t fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona’s elemental power will differ from the rest of their family’s.

## Bard
A Drakonic bard takes the stage, their presence demanding adoration. With scales like polished gold, they gleam with hypnotic allure. Their canorous voice oscillates with bass resonance, weaving ballads of ancient love and heroic deeds. The performance is spellbinding, a heady mix of magic and wonder.

## Innkeeper
The green of age rims the bronze scales of this Drakona’s broad shoulders, but his craggy face retains a youthful guise. He sets aside a fistful of full tankards and regards you with a welcoming grin. His tail drifts up with a cloth upon it, and he takes it in hand to wipe at some spilled ale without ever once taking his eyes off you.

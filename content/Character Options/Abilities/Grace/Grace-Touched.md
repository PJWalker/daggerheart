When 4 or more of the domain cards in your loadout are from the [[Character Options/Abilities/Grace/index|Grace]] domain, gain the following benefits:

- You can mark an Armor Slot instead of marking a Stress.
- When you would force a target to mark a number of Hit Points, you can choose instead to force them to mark that number of Stress.

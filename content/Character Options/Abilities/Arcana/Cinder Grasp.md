Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Melee range. On a success, the target instantly bursts into flames, takes `dice:12d20+3` magic damage, and is temporarily lit On Fire.

When a creature acts while On Fire, they must take an extra `dice:2d6` magic damage if they are still On Fire at the end of their action.

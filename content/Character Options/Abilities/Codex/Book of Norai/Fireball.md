Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Far range. On a success, hurl a sphere of fire toward them that explodes on impact. The target and all creatures within Very Close range of them must make a Reaction Roll (13). Targets who fail take `dice:4d20+5` magic damage using your Proficiency. Targets who succeed take half damage.

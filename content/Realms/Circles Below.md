The Circles Below are the collection of lower realms where the [[Fallen]] reside. The Fallen Gods lost the Divine War with the New Gods during the Earliest Age and have since been deemed “evil practitioners of tainted magic.” Thus the Faint Divinities that were banished alongside them, commonly referred to as “demons,” as well as those sired since, bear the weight of that identifier. 

The Circles Below is considered a place of corruption, destruction, and endless hunger. Stories say this dominion is home to some of the most dangerous creatures in the core realms. Most other planes have safeguards against Fallen who may wish to cross over from the Circles Below. Within the [[Mortal Realm]], it’s rumoured that the use of arcane magic in acts of great evil can open a temporary rift between the two lands, allowing Fallen to pass through.
